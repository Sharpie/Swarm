The DrugWar app is a toy model of three social influences on drug
trafficking behavior.  Each agent uses a boolean polynomial to assess
whether or not to become part of a drug cartel's supply chain
operations.  The inputs to the polynomial are:

1. Facts -- The agent sees the world around her.

2. Coercion -- The agent receives coercive pressure from law
   enforcement (the threat of imprisonment) and the drug cartel (the
   threat of bodily harm or harm to possessions or family memnbers).

3. Social Pressure -- The agent feels moral or ethical pressure from
   the social structures to which she belongs.

Each variable in the polynomial has a coefficient with which to 
modify the agent's relative weighting of the 3 inputs.

The only other parametrization provided for the agents is the 
"awarenessNet", which is a list of aquaintances for the agent,
which define the paths by which the pressures can reach her.
