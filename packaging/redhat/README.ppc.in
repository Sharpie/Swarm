Binary RPM packages of Swarm for LinuxPPC R5 (1999) users are
available here.

Source packages are available at:

 ftp://ftp.santafe.edu/pub/swarm/redhat/SRPMS

Minimum requirements
====================

The following Red Hat packages that come with the standard Linux PPC
R5 (in most respects identical to Red Hat 6.0 for Intel machines)
distribution are all required before commencing installing *any* of
various Swarm packages:

 @base_requires@

[Note depending on the kind of installation option you selected, some,
or all of these are installed by default].

For the PPC platform *only* you will also need to have installed the
libffi-1.20 package, also available in this directory.

Demo package
============

The `swarmdemos' package installs a handful of swarm applications, and
requires only the following packages: "blt, tcl, tk, zlib, libpng,
xpm" and does not require a Swarm installation.  It's ideal for
`test-driving' a Swarm application.

* swarmdemos-@version@-@demo_release@.ppc.rpm

Advanced Swarm packages (NOT REQUIRED FOR NEW USERS):
====================================================

swarm-static contains the Swarm libraries statically-linked, useful
when you wish to profile an application:

* swarm-static-@version@-@release@.ppc.rpm

  you will require one of the `swarm-base' packages to be
  pre-installed.

[Note: this package is *not* required for any Swarm functionality, and
will generally not be required by new or novice users].
