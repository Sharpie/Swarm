Binary RPM packages of Swarm for LinuxPPC R5 (1999) users are
available here.

Source packages are available at:

 ftp://ftp.santafe.edu/pub/swarm/redhat/SRPMS

Minimum requirements
====================

The following Red Hat packages that come with the standard Linux PPC
R5 (in most respects identical to Red Hat 6.0 for Intel machines)
distribution are all required before commencing installing *any* of
various Swarm packages:

 @base_requires@

[Note depending on the kind of installation option you selected, some,
or all of these are installed by default].

For the PPC platform *only* you will also need to have installed the
libffi-1.20 package, also available in this directory.

Demo package
============

The `swarmdemos' package installs a handful of swarm applications, and
requires only the following packages: "blt, tcl, tk, zlib, libpng,
xpm" and does not require a Swarm installation.  It's ideal for
`test-driving' a Swarm application.

* swarmdemos-@version@-@release@.ppc.rpm

Basic Swarm packages:
====================

At this stage for PPC users there is only `swarm-base' packages for
Swarm development in Objective C (we are still in the process of
porting HDF5 to PPC):

* swarm-@version@-@release@.ppc.rpm: 

  the `vanilla' Objective C Swarm package, which requires only the 
  minimum requirements outlined above.

Java support enabling `add-on' package:
=======================================

* Kaffe 1.0.4b with respect to Swarm is broken on the PPC platform,
since we have limited resources (and one *very slow* PPC) we would
appreciate hearing from any PPC users who would like to assist us in
testing and debugging Kaffe and Swarm under the PowerPC platform.

* We have had reports of successful installation on PPC against the
Blackdown JDK 1.2 (http://www.blackdown.org) with an install of Swarm
from source, but no RPMs as yet.

Advanced Swarm packages (not required for new users):
====================================================

swarm-static contains the Swarm libraries statically-linked, useful
when you wish to profile an application:

* swarm-static-@version@-@release@.ppc.rpm

  you will require one of the `swarm-base' packages to be
  pre-installed.

[Note: this package is *not* required for any Swarm functionality, and
will generally not be required by new or novice users].
