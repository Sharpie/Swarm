Binary RPM packages of Swarm for Red Hat 6.0 Intel/ix86 users are
available here.

[NOTE: Although there is no reason why these RPMs should not work
       under Red Hat 6.1, they are not yet tested specifically under 
       6.1, hence your mileage may vary.]

Source packages are available at:

 ftp://ftp.santafe.edu/pub/swarm/redhat/SRPMS

Minimum requirements
====================

The following packages that come with the standard Red Hat 6.0
distribution are all required before commencing installing *any* of
various Swarm packages:

 @base_requires@

[Note depending on the kind of Red Hat installation option you selected, 
some, or all of these are installed by default].

Demo package
============

The `swarmdemos' package installs a handful of swarm applications, and
requires only the following packages: "blt, tcl, tk, zlib, libpng,
xpm" and does not require a Swarm installation.  It's ideal for
`test-driving' a Swarm application.

* swarmdemos-@version@-@demo_release@.i386.rpm

Basic Swarm packages:
====================

There are two `swarm-base' packages for Swarm development in Objective
C, you should choose _one_:

* swarm-@version@-@release@.i386.rpm: 

  the `vanilla' Objective C Swarm package, which requires only the 
  minimum requirements outlined above.

* swarm-hdf5-@version@-@release@.i386.rpm 

  with hdf5 support, which requires hdf5-1.2 or better (RPM-ed by Paul
  Johnson and available at his site¹, or below)

Java support enabling `add-on' package:
=======================================
(*REQUIRED IF PROGRAMMING IN JAVA*):

You can add Java support to *either* of the above `swarm-base'
packages

[Note: this is *not* required if you wish to purely program in
Objective C and not in Java]:

* swarm-kaffe-@version@-@release@.i386.rpm

  which requires kaffe-@kaffe_version@ 

  available from the official kaffe.org ftp site:

  ftp://www.kaffe.org/pub/kaffe/binaries/linux/kaffe-1.0.5-6.i386.rpm

  (Note: this RPM is *not* yet available in any Red Hat distribution,
  but has the advantage of supporting JDK 1.2 features.  Use the older
  swarm-2.0.1-2.i386.rpm if you wish to use kaffe-1.0.4b-2.i386.rpm).

Advanced Swarm packages: 
========================
(*NOT REQUIRED FOR NEW USERS*)

swarm-static contains the Swarm libraries statically-linked, useful
when you wish to profile an application:

* swarm-static-@version@-@release@.i386.rpm

  you will require one of the `swarm-base' packages to be
  pre-installed.

[Note: this package is *not* required for any Swarm functionality, and
will generally not be required by new or novice users].
