Heatbugs don't display themselves properly (although the HeatSpace
does): Need to fix Heatbug.drawSelfOn(Raster) method which is called
via the Object2dDisplayImpl instance [currently the
heatbugDisplay.display() method is commented-out in the
HeatbugObserverSwarm._update_ method].  Ideally method should accept
an argument of `Raster' type, rather than `Object'.

Drag-n-drop of probed heatbug into `graphBug' in HeatbugObserverSwarm
probe display not working.

Fix enableDestroyNotification on the unhappyGraph [currently commented
out], currently not working, possibly a problem with how EZGraph is
exposed to Java.

No data appearing on EZGraph: fix createAverageSequence on the
unhappyGraph [currently commented out].
