// SimpleCbug

                   THE STARTING POINT

main.m

This is a simple C program implemented in an extremely simple
ObjectiveC/Swarm file. 

It implements a "bug" taking a random walk. There is no 
"spatial" data-structure in this model in which the "bug" lives. 
The xPos and yPos coordinates take simple random walks, modulo 
maximum X and Y values. Think of the bug taking a random walk
on a torus (enforced by the modulus ("%") operator.)

There is no object-oriented code here - and very little of Swarm.
This is just our starting point to develop the concept of Swarm
as we introduce Object Oriented and Swarm programming a little
bit at a time.


Makefile

  We'll be following the growing complexity of the Makefile along
with this tutorial, so that you can understand how the more
complicated ones get to be that way.

This one is pretty self-explanatory
