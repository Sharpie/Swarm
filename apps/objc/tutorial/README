		SIMPLEBUG SWARM TUTORIAL


This tutorial takes the user through the development of a Swarm
model that makes use of a lot of the functionality of Swarm.

The model consists of bugs taking random walks in space. There
is nothing particular about the model to recomend itself to`
our attention, except that it is so simple that it won't get in 
the way of the explication of Swarm as we go along. 

We start out with a very simple, essentially C program for
a bug taking a random walk. Through a progression of models
we introduce basic object-oriented and swarm style programming.

Although this is a particulary simple exercise, it shows how 
easy it is to compose fairly complex software from simple
building blocks. 

In this directory are 8 subdirectories, each with a complete
Swarm application and a README file that walks you through
the code.

You should start with the "simpleCBug" application, and follow
the pointers at the bottom of the README files. You will
go through them in the follwing order:

simpleCBug
simpleObjCBug
simpleObjcBug2
simpleSwarmBug
simpleSwarmBug2
simpleSwarmBug3
simpleObserverBug
simpleObserverBug2
simpleExperBug

Once you have gone all the way through this tutorial, you should be
able to make sense of many of the applications on the Swarm
web-site.  They can appear to be quite complex, but once you
get a feel for the underlying patterns, they are really not
that hard to understand, or to build.


On building the applications.

If you have swarm installed, you should just be able to edit the
Makefile in each application to point to SWARMHOME on your 
system. 

Then just type make, and the applications should build.

To run any of them, just type "bug" after they've built and linked.
