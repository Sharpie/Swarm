               LOADING AND SAVING PARAMETERS

main.m

Again, this file will not change very much from now on. All of
the action is happening in the model objects themselves.


ModelSwarm.h and ModelSwarm.m

Only a small change here. By now, we're tired of altering the default
parameters in the code and then recompiling each time. 

In -buildObjects, we take advantage of an ObjectLoader to read in
the state variables of the ModelSwarm from a file. 

Now, we can change the parameters of the model by editing the
file "model.setup", which has a simple format:

@begin
worldXSize 80
worldYSize 80
seedProb 0.9
bugDensity 0.01
@end

ObjectLoader has a partner called ObjectSaver that will write out an
objects instance variables.
