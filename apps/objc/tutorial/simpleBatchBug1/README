    		RUNNING IN BATCH MODE


In simpleObserverSwarm3, we considered some ways you can run models
and keep records on them.  The approach was decidedly GUI,
however. The program that resulted when you compiled with this
command:

make EXTRACPPFLAGS=-DUNATTENDED

would run for a given number of steps, take a picture, and then close
down.  That allowed you to create a script that would run the program
over and over.

That approach has some disadvantages. First, it might waste time. The
program would run faster if you turned off the graphical interface.
Sometimes the difference is dramatic.  In order to turn off the
graphical interface, we introduce a new class called BatchSwarm and we
redesign the main.m so that it chooses between a GUI ObserverSwarm or
a non-GUI BatchSwarm.  

Second, you might want to collect lots and lots of data.  Sometimes a
screenshot is enough, sometimes it isn't. You may need more detailed
records.  There are several ways in which this can be done. 

In simpleBatchSwarm1, the emphasis is on the creation of a batch model
framework. It does not do much. When you run the batch model with the
command

./bug -b

the model runs without a graphical interface and quits after a
designated number of iterations.  It does not do anything except print
some messages to the screen.  It does not save data.  The data output
and analysis issues are explored in simpleBatchSwarm2.

main.m

In main.m, you should see one major innovation.  There is a global
Swarm variable called "swarmGUIMode" and it is equal to YES if you run
the model in the ordinary way, but it is equal to NO if you start the
model with the batch flag, which is -b. If swarmGUIMode is YES, then
the ObserverSwarm acts as the top level swarm and if swarmGUIMode is
NO, then the BatchSwarmis the top level Swarm.

BatchSwarm

The BatchSwarm is a parallel to the ObserverSwarm, in the sense that
it creates the Model, tells the model to run, and tells the model to stop.
However, there are some differences.  First, since we don't want a
graphical interface, the BatchSwarm is subclassed from Swarm, rather than 
GUISwarm (as is ObserverSwarm).  

If you only want the BatchSwarm to start and stop the simulation, then
BatchSwarm can be quite a simple thing. In this section, we elect to
keep things as simple as possible.  BatchSwarmm.m has a schedule,
called stopSchedule, and it has only one action placed into it.  At
the time "experimentDuration", it tells the model to "stopRunning".
It does not keep any record keeping objects, does not write out any
time series data.  All it does is start and stop the model.

Sometimes you want a model to run until something happens. Suppose
all the food is gone, or all the bugs are dead.  If you wanted
that to happen,  you would approach the schedule design differently.
You would schedule a method with a name called "checkToStop" to
run frequently. It could ask the modelSwarm to report back if
something has happened, and then the "checkToStop" method could 
trigger "stopRunning".  For an example like that, look ahead
to simpleBatchBug2.

Don't forget to introduce the BatchSwarm.o in here!

Parameters

Note that the Parameters class is still used. It can grab command line
options whether the model is run in batch model or not.  We want to
facilitate the user who runs a program over and over again. So the
"run" variable in the Parameters class can be used to keep track of
which data goes with which run.

Conclusion

A BatchSwarm class can be a complicated beast, or it can be extremely
simple. The choice is up to you.  When you redesign your model to run
in batch mode, you gain speed and standardization. 

In batch mode, you give up the graphical interface. If you want to
keep records on your model, then you have to learn to write out
results and analyze them.  The data analysis is rather outside the
purview of Swarm, but we can get you started with the comments
in simpleBatchBug2.
