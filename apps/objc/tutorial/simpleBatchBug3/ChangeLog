	* In Output.m removed the asprintf and replaced them with a snprintf hack
	  for comptability with Solaris.

	* In Output.m updated createGraphWriter to have a dynamic string instead
	of a static one for hdfEZGraphName.

	* In Output.m:

		* Added an underscore to the output file names (output_ and hdfGraph_) in
		createGraphWriter and prepareCOutputFile.
	
		* Brackets, whitespace, and documentation changes to prepareCOutputFile.
	
		* Changed the type of outputFile in prepareCOutput file to char* from
		char[256], made the appropriate changes in the code.
	
		* Removed the spaces when a run number was specified in timeString from
		createTimeString.
	
		* Whitespace formatting in writeCData.

	* Added a "cleandata" flag to the Makefile.
	
	* Clarified code a bit in createTimeString, no functional changes--

		*changed timeString to a pointer,
		*made the appropriate changes surrounding that change
		*rewrote the else side of the runNumber if branch
