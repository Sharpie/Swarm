	* Added a "cleandata" flag to the Makefile.
	
	* Clarified code a bit in createTimeString, no functional changes--
	things like bracket alignment and whitespace.
	
	* Made some functional changes to Output:
	
		*changed timeString to a pointer,
		*made the appropriate changes surrounding that change
		*rewrote the else side of the runNumber if branch
