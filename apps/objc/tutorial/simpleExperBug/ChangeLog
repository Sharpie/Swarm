	* main.m: Include simtoolsgui.h.

	* FoodSpace.m: Include random.h. Reformatting throughtout.

	* ModelSwarm.m: Likewise.

	* ExperSwarm.m: Include simtoolsgui.h.

	* ExperSwarm.h: Don't include activity.h, collections.h, or
	simtools.h.  Include simtoolsgui/GUISwarm.h.

	* Bug.m: Include random.h instead of simtools.h.

1998-02-26  Alex Lancaster  <alex@santafe.edu>

	* README: Updated to reflect changes.
	
	* ModelSwarm.m ([ModelSwarm -build{Objects,Actions}]): Made all
	references to object creation in create: and createBegin: calls be
	to "self" rather than the redundant [self getZone].  Swarms are
	now responsible for managing their own Zones.
	
	* ExperSwarm.m ([ExperSwarm -build{Objects,Actions}]): Likewise.
	
	* ExperSwarm.m ([ExperSwarm -dropModel]): Removed drop of
	probeDisplay and made the drop message directly to the modelSwarm,
	rather than the redundant modelZone.
	
	* ExperSwarm.[hm] ([ExperSwarm -buildModel]): Removed redundant
	variable modelZone and its creation and use.  Also removed the
	creation of the archived probeDisplay for modelSwarm, so that
	simulations can be without any displays to interrupt cycling
	through different models.

	* ExperSwarm.h: Include objectbase.h instead of swarmobject.h.
	to fully comply with new API.

1998-02-04  Marcus G. Daniels  <mgd@wijiji.santafe.edu>

	* ModelSwarm.h: Include objectbase.h instead of swarmobject.h.

	* ModelSwarm.h, Bug.h: Include from objectbase/ instead of
	swarmobject/.

1998-01-27  Marcus G. Daniels  <mgd@wijiji.santafe.edu>

	* main.m (main): Constify argv.

1998-01-26  Marcus G. Daniels  <mgd@wijiji.santafe.edu>

	* ExperSwarm.h, ModeSwarm.h: Don't include tkobjc.h.

	* Bug.m ([Bug -drawSelfOn:]): Remove.

	* Bug.h: Remove declaration of drawSelfOn:. 
	Reformatting throughout.

1998-01-15  Marcus G. Daniels  <mgd@wijiji.santafe.edu>

	* ExperSwarm.m ([ExperSwarm -buildObjects]): Use
	SET_WINDOW_GEOMETRY_RECORD_NAME for resultGraph.

	* main.m (main): Likewise, but for experSwarm.

1998-01-13  Marcus G. Daniels  <mgd@wijiji.santafe.edu>

	* ExperSwarm.m ([ParameterManager -initializeParameters]): Use
	CREATE_ARCHIVED_PROBE_DISPLAY to create probe display for
	ParameterManager.
	([ExperSwarm -buildObjects]): Likewise, but for ExperSwarm.
	([ExperSwarm -buildModel]): Likewise, but for modelSwarm.

	* main.m (main): Call setWindowGeometryRecordName on experSwarm.
	Reformatting throughout.
	
	* ModelSwarm.h: Reformatting throughout.

	* Makefile (SWARMHOME): Don't define if already defined.

	* ExperSwarm.m ([ParameterManager -initializeParameters]): 
	Use setWindowGeometryRecordName version of createProbeDisplayFor.
	([ParameterManager -printParameters:]): Don't use statically
	typed OutFile, declare compliance with OutFile protocol instead.
	([ExperSwarm +createBegin:]): Don't use statically typed ProbeMap,
	declare compliance with ProbeMap protocol instead.
	([ExperSwarm -buildObjects]): Use setWindowGeometryRecordName
	version of createProbeDisplayFor.
	([ExperSwarm -buildObjects]): Call setWindowGeometryRecordName
	for resultGraph.
	([ExperSwarm -buildActions]): Send doTkEvents to actionCache,
	not controlPanel.
	([ExperSwarm -checkToStop]): Send doTkEvents to actionCache, not
	controlPanel.
	Reformatting throughout.

	* ExperSwarm.h (ParameterManager): Don't use statically
	typed pmProbeMap, declare compliance with ProbeMap protocol.
	(ExperSwarm): Don't statically type logFile, declare compliance
	with OutFile protocol.  Reformatting throughout.
