MAKE AN EXPERIMENT SWARM TO MANAGE MULTIPLE RUNS OF A MODEL, SWEEPING
PARAMETERS, GRAPHING MODEL RESULTS, AND LOGGING RESULTS TO A FILE


In this version of the simpleBug model, we turn the ObserverSwarm into
an ExperimentSwarm, in which we encapsulate the functions that we as
experimenters might perform in running multiple copies of the
simpleObserverBug experiment: changing some parameter in a regular
way, graphing the results of the different runs, and writing up the
results of each experiment in a log.

Once again, we gather together the various functions that we perform
in some role (as an experimenter in this case) into an object that we
can treat like a "thing," which we can then use as an intelligent
assistant in our work with models.

Again, the top and bottom levels (main.m and the Bug and FoodSpace)
remain pretty much unchanged. Most of the new functionality comes at
the middle level - in ExperSwarm

---------------------------------------------------------------------

main.m

The only change here is that we have changed the name of the top level
swarm to "ExperSwarm".


ExperSwarm.h and ExperSwarm.m

Here, we extend a basic observerSwarm to a full-fledged experiment
Swarm.

The first thing to note is that these files now contain the interface
and implementation declarations for *two* objects: a ParameterManager
and an ExperSwarm. We could have created separate .h and .m files for
the ParameterManager object, as we've done for each of the new objects
before. However, the parameterManager is very closely allied with the
ExperSwarm itself - essentially a helper-object - so we include it in
the same file as the ExperSwarm.

As we add quite a bit of new capability in these objects, we'll go 
through both of them method-by-method.

1)  ParameterManager

  The ParameterManager is a special object that we will use to manage
the way that we sweep through parameter space over a set of experimental
runs of the modelSwarm. It is responsible for initializing the model
each time we create a new one, for incrementing one or more parameters
each time we run a model, and for printing the current values of 
the parameters out to a log-file when we ask it to. 


-initializeParameters: 

   Here, we load the parameters for the whole experimental run, and 
   create a probeDisplay on the parameterManager itself, allowing us 
   to alter the experiment parameters before we start the run. 

   As before with modelSwarm, we load the experiment parameters using an 
   ObjectLoader from a file called "experiment.setup". In addition to the 
   model parameters, this file holds the increments by which we should step
   through the various parameters, and the maximimum values these parameters 
   should take.


-stepParameters:

   Here, we increment the various parameters by whatever increment
   was specified in the "experiment.setup" file, test to see if we
   have finished sweeping any of them, and return "nil" if we have.

   There are many different parameter sweeping routines that we could have 
   used. The specific code in this method will often be model-specific. 

   To sweep over both parameters, we could increment one of them every
   time we are stepped, stepping the other only when the first reaches its
   max and is reset.

   It is possible that one could create a general purpose experiment-swarm
   with an associated parameter manager, but this is left as an exercise
   to the reader. Here we are mostly concerned with illustrating how one
   goes about managing creating, initializing, running, analyzing,
   and dropping a sequence of models. 


-printParameters:

   The printParameters method is passed a pointer to an OutFile, 
   a Swarm Library object that manages file I/O. The ParameterManager
   simply saves itself to that file-object using the ObjectSaver capability. 


2)  ExperSwarm 

  The ExperSwarm is similar to the ObserverSwarm of the simpleObserverBug 
tutorial application, however there are some important differences.
In this instance, we want to run a bunch of models, but not view
them graphically, so we don't build any display widgets on the model
Swarm, other than a probeDisplay.


-buildObjects:

  First, you will notice that buildObjects does *not* create an instance
of ModelSwarm.

  It simply builds its own objects: an instance of ParameterManager, a 
probeDisplay on itself, an EZGraph to display run results, and a "log.file" 
to record run results. We will be building and dropping a series of instances
of ModelSwarm during the course of the experiment, so we package-up the code 
to build a modelSwarm in its own method, which we can call over and over 
again.


-buildActions:

  In buildActions, we create a schedule mostly containing actions on the 
ExperSwarm itself. This is a useful device for scheduling actions that 
themselves are compound. As the events in our activities become more 
complicated, it becomes useful to package up related actions in methods 
within "self" whose names capture the functionality that the collection of 
actions will carry out. This allows us to organize activities at higher 
levels of functionality, keeping schedules from becoming incomprehensible 
lists of low-level message calls. 

  The schedule we build here contains the basic actions that we
will perform for every model we run in the course of the experiment.
We build the model, run it, collect data on the run, graphically
display some of the results, write the results out to a file, 
drop the model, check if we've run all the models we need to,
and then do some display updates. These actions are scheduled
here, but not executed, so we'll discuss their implementation later.


-activateIn:

  In ActivateIn, note again that we only activate the ExperSwarm
itself, and its schedule. We do *not* activate a modelSwarm, because
we haven't built one yet, and we are going to have to activate and
deactivate a series of modelSwarms. We package the modelSwarm
activation up in the method to build the model itself.


// --- End of ExperSwarm buildObjects, buildActions, and activateIn ---


  We've defined buildObjects, buildActions, and activateIn for ExperSwarm.

  This is where the implementation for a normal swarm would usually end. 
However, we've defined a number of actions via method calls on ourselves, 
so we define those here. 

  Note that ExperSwarm invokes these on itself, and no other object will, 
or should, attempt to invoke them. Therefore, we do not declare them
in ExperSwarm.h. The @interface is where we declare to the world what 
methods we will respond to. If we don't expect, or want, other objects 
to invoke a particular method, there is no sense in declaring it to the 
world. These methods encapsulate bits of *how* the ExperSwarm does what it 
does, and are not relevant to the outside world in terms of *what* it does.


-buildModel:

  First, buildModel does pretty much what we previously did in the
buildObjects method when we only built a single model. The first thing
it does is to create an instance of the modelSwarm. (Note that we now
no longer need to create a separate modelZone - as the Swarm itself
can now handle this). Since we are going to build a number of models,
we only want to do some things the first time we build a model, such
as build a customized probeMap for the modelSwarm class. Once an
instance of ModelSwarm has been created (we no longer display the
probeMap for the modelSwarm) we initialize it with the current
parameter settings, and then we proceed with the normal invocations of
buildObjects, buildActions, and activateIn on the modelSwarm.

  Notice, however, that rather than activate the modelSwarm in
ourselves, as before, we activate it in "nil", establishing it as a
separate activity from us. We do this for several reasons. The
time-scales of the modelSwarm and experSwarm are different. Each major
step of the experiment will run a model through as many of its major
steps as it takes to complete, so we do *not* want to merge the
modelSchedule and the experSchedule. Rather, the ExperSwarm activates
the new modelSwarm in "nil", and then, via the "runModel" method,
starts the modelSwarm schedule, letting it iterate over and over again
until it reaches completion, at which point control returns to the
experSchedule, which will move to its next action. Thus, a large
number of iterations of the modelSwarm's schedule takes place during a
single action of the experSwarm schedule.

  Also, it will be easier to drop the modelSwarm's activity if we
keep it separate from our own, without merging it into our activity
structure.


-runModel:

  In runModel, we simply get the activity of the modelSwarm, and tell
it to "run". When the modelSwarm is done, control will return here. When 
it does, we announce that the model is done, increment the number of models 
run, and return, allowing the experSchedule to move on to its next action..


-doStats:

  Simply collects a data-point on the modelSwarm, and then prints it out. 
Clearly, much more data-collection could be done on the modelSwarm here.
This is the place to do it, before it is dropped.


-getModelTime:

  This method is used as a feed to resultGraph. We could not create the 
resultGraph with a feed from modelSwarm because 1) we had no instance of 
modelSwarm to point it to yet, and 2) we would be changing the specific 
modelSwarm that we wanted to use as a feed many times during the course of 
the experiment. So, we feed the EZGraph sequence from this method, which
will get the necessary data form a succession of modelSwarm instances. 


-logResults:

  This makes use of an OutFile object to archive the parameter settings and 
results for each run of the model. It asks the ParameterManager to print
out its state into the file as well, so the specific parameters for
each run will be recorded together with the results of the run.


-showStats:

  This simply steps the resultGraph. We could have done this directly
from the experSchedule, but do it this way here because the details of
what we might want to do for a specific action in experSchedule might
change, yet still fulfill the same "function." If we'd built another
graph, or a histogram, we could add "step" calls on them here, without
changing the action in the experSchedule. This keeps the schedule
cleaner, calling on high-level functions rather than explicitly
handling the details of those functions. In fact, it is treating these
methods almost as if they were objects themselves.

  We're always on the lookout for ways to package up functionality in
convenient "chunks," which we can then manipulate, and use as building
blocks, without caring what is inside them.


-dropModel:

  This method handles dropping an instance of ModelSwarm after we are
through with it, in order to reclaim its storage, and to pave the way
for other objects to point to a new instance of ModelSwarm. Here, we
first drop things created in ExperSwarm that point to the modelSwarm,
and then we drop everything we built in modelSwarm by simply dropping
the modelSwarm itself We drop the modelSwarm activity before we drop
the modelSwarm, as some of the activity objects were created in the
modelSwarm, and if we dropped the modelSwarm first, we'd crash when we
tried to drop the activities.


-checkToStop:

  This is where we determine if we are through with the whole sequence
of model runs making up the experiment run. We first step the
parameters. If any parameter goes out of bounds as a result of this
step, the parameterManager will return "nil", and we know that we are
done. If we're done, we report it and close the logFile by dropping
it. We also halt the ExperSwarm activity, which returns control to the
controlPanel, where we'll probably just push the quit button, since
the experimental run is done. If we're not done, we simply return,
having stepped the parameters to their proper values for the next
model run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the fundamental changes were in the ExperSwarm. However, a few
changes had to be made in other objects, to allow ExperSwarm to set
and get values its needs for managing an experimental run.


ModelSwarm.h and ModelSwarm.m

  Here, we have added a couple of methods that will allow the
experSwarm to initialize the model parameters.  We also keep track of
the runtime of the model, as this data will be collected by the
Experiment Swarm when we are done. Otherwise, everything is the same
as before.


FoodSpace.h and FoodSpace.m

  Here, we keep count of the total food that we created, so that we
can tell when it has all been eaten. Bugs can tell us when they've
eaten food by calling the -bugAte method on us. We also add a -getFood
method so that the modelSwarm can end its run when the food is all
gone.


Bug.h and Bug.m

The only new thing here is that we have the bug tell the foodSpace
when it eats some food, via the -bugAte method on FoodSpace.


----------------------------------------------------------------

log.file

After the experiment has run to completion, this file will have been
created which contains the parameter settings and results from each
run of the model.


NEXT ->  from here, you should go and look at some of the other
         apps that are up on the web-site (heatbugs, mousetraps,
         etc.) We've arrived at almost that level of complexity.
         Hopefully, by building up to this complexity bit by
         bit, Swarm makes more sense to you. You should also
         remember that many things are the way they are in
         Swarm strictly because of convention. There's no reason
         why Swarm's can't be arranged in other than the
         Observer/Model relation that we've pursued here. It
         is just a convenient way to break up the functionality
         into managable pieces.
