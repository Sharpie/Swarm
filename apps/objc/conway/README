I wanted a Conway Game of Life CA to show in class,
so I started with my recently updated version of 
Benedikt's Schelling model, hacked away, and happily 
arrived at this.

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automata with cells
that are two-valued, and if you run it the way it is,
you see some interesting things.

Some interesting GUI things:

Right click on a square to change its color.

You can erase the whole space and then right click
to experiment with shapes.
