<h1>Suggested Exercises for Swarm Sugarscape</h1>

Here are some ideas to get you working with Sugarscape and Swarm. Some
of these require just running Swarm and playing with it - some require
modifying the source code of Swarm in simple or complicated ways. A
guideline of the difficulty of each problem is put in parenthesis.<p>

<h2>I. Working with the existing model</h2>

<ol>
  <li>(Easy, sss-1) Do an experiment on how the final carrying capacity of
      the system varies with the initial population. Write down a
      hypothesis, then design an experiment to test that hypothesis by
      varying the initial population size. Draw a graph of the result,
      evaluate the hypothesis, and draw conclusions.

  <li>(Medium, sss-1) Do an experiment to discover the effects of maximum
      vision and metabolism on agent survival. Follow the procedure
      described in I.1 - make a hypothesis, design an experiment, plot
      the results, draw conclusions.
      
  <li>(Medium, sss-1) The file <tt>sugarscape.pgm</tt> contains the
      layout of the
      maximum food in the world. It's in a simple format. Copy
      <tt>sss-1</tt> and <tt>sugarscape.pgm</tt> into your own
      directory and modify <tt>sugarscape.pgm</tt> so the world has a
      different topography. (You can use any text editor, like
      <tt>emacs</tt> or <tt>xedit</tt> to edit the file).
      Make four hills
      instead of two, or a valley, or something entirely unrealistic.
      What effect does the new shape of the world have on the system
      dynamics?

  <li>(Medium - Hard, sss-2) What causes the uneven wealth distribution we
      see in <a href="cdrom/animate/ch2/ch2_03.mov">animation
      II-3</a>? Is it the agent death and replacement rule <b>R</b>?
      Is it the uneven distribution of food in <tt>sugarspace.pgm</tt>?
      Is it the variance in maximum age, or metabolism or vision? Pick
      one or two parameters of the model with the replacement rule and
      see how their variance affects the wealth distribution.

  <li>(Medium) Write a small critique of the model. Explain what some
      of the assumptions built into the model are and evaluate whether
      those assumptions are reasonable. How would you improve the
      model to make it more realistic?

      
</ol>

<h2>II. Changing the Swarm Program</h2>

These assignments require modifying the Swarm source code in simple
ways. They require some programming skill, but are not too difficult.
Doing one of these exercises will make you more familiar with the program.<p>

<ol>
  <li>(Easy) Change the initial position of agents so they all start
      in the corner. This produces a migration pattern, as in page 42
      of the book and
      in <a href="cdrom/animate/ch2/ch2_06.mov">animation II-6</a>.
  <li>(Medium) Add seasonal migration, as in page 45 of the book and
      in <a href="cdrom/animate/ch2/ch2_07.mov">animation II-7</a>.
  <li>(Medium) Change the agent movement rule so the agent picks any
      of the best spots it can see - not just the closest.
  <li>(Medium) Change the system so two agents can be on the same
      square. Does this change anything?
</ol>

<h2>III. Adding things to the model</h2>

These exercises require more sophisticated programming - adding new
objects to the model an new behaviours. It's great if you can do one
of these, but don't feel bad if it seems too complicated at first.<p>

<ol>
  <li>(Medium) Add in sex - allow agents to have children. Page 54.
  <li>(Hard) Add in inheritance - children inherit their parents'
      wealth when the parents die. Page 67.
  <li>(Hard) Add culture, page 71.
  <li>(Medium) Add a second commodity - spice. Make agents require spice as
      well as sugar to live. (Chapter 4 - page 94).
  <li>(Hard) Have agents trade spice with each other. Page 101
      describes a complicated trade rule, but feel free to invent
      something simpler.
</ol>
