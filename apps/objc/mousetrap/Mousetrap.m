// Mousetraps are, well, mousetraps that live in fixed positions on
// a 2D lattice. Each mousetrap has N "ping-pong" balls. When "triggered"
// (hit by another ping-pong ball) it releases its ping-pong balls
// into the air, which hit other mousetraps and trigger them.
// Tossing ping-pong balls into the air to trigger other mousetraps
// is accomplished by picking "nearby" mousetraps, and arranging for
// them to be sent trigger messages in the "near" future.

// This is a discrete-event model of object updates in time.
// The discrete event model is implemented via *dynamic scheduling*
