This is the Heatbug demo app.  The code is very well commented,
so the only thing that needs to be said here is that if you want
to see little pictures (pixmap) running around instead of squares,
then run make like so:

   make CPPFLAGS=-DUSE_PIXMAP

* Also, you can write screenshots for each update to PNG files
if you build like this:

   make CPPFLAGS=-DSCREENSHOTS

* A new feature is that with the additional
`randomizeHeatbugUpdateOrder' Boolean flag we can randomize the order
in which the bugs actually run their step rule.  This has the effect
of removing any systematic bias in the iteration throught the heatbug
list from timestep to timestep

By default, this flag is not set (to duplicate the behavoir of the
previous heatbug versions), but you can override this by setting the
flag in the probe display for HeatbugModelSwarm.

* A note relevant to all Swarm application, not just heatbugs:

By default, all `createActionForEach' modelActions have a default
order of `Sequential', which means that the order of iteration through
the `heatbugList' will be identical (assuming the list order is not
changed indirectly by some other process).  

In other words, unless you explicitly set the default order (using the
-setDefaultOrder method) you will have the `Sequential' behavoir.
