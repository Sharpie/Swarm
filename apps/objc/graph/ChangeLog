	the Canvas protocol, nodeItem to the NodeItem protocol.
	Reformatting throughout.

	* DiGraphLink.m: Include gui.h instead of tkobjc.h.
	Reformatting throughout.

	* DiGraphLink.h: Reformatting throughout.

	* DiGraph.m: Include gui.h instead of tkobjc.h.

1998-01-19  Alex Lancaster  <alex@santafe.edu>

	* Makefile: Added $(CURDIR), $(DISTSRC) and $(SRCS) to create a
	completely generic "make dist" target for eventual inclusion in
	a configuration Makefile.

1998-01-16  Alex Lancaster  <alex@santafe.edu>

	* Makefile (dist): Added new target to create archive. Creates it
	in the current directory with a directory name specified by a
	$TARNAME variable.

1998-01-14  Marcus G. Daniels  <mgd@wijiji.santafe.edu>

	* DiGraphLink.m: Don't do anything except set the canvas variable
	if canvas is nil.

	* DiGraphLink.m ([DiGraphLink -setCanvas:]): Likewise.

	* DiGraph.m ([DiGraph -setCanvas:]): Apply setCanvas to all nodes.

1998-01-13  Marcus G. Daniels  <mgd@wijiji.santafe.edu>

	* DiGraphNode.m ([DiGraphNode -showContent]): Use
	CREATE_PROBE_DISPLAY.

	* Makefile (SWARMHOME): Bump to version 1.0.5.

1998-01-12  Alex Lancaster  <alex@santafe.edu>

	* DiGraphLink.[hm]: Added ([DiGraphLink -hideLink]) for
	interactive dropping of links. Modified ([DiGraph -createEnd]) and
	([DiGraph -setCanvas]) to allow these methods to be performed in
	any order.

	* DiGraphNode.[hm]: Added ([DiGraphNode -hideNode]) to allow
	 dropping of node from Canvas independent of dropping of node
	 itself.

	* DiGraphNode.[hm]: Added ([DiGraphNode -getToLinks]) and
	([DiGraphNode -getFromLinks]) for a DiGraph object to probe the
	node's links.

	* DiGraph.m Added methods ([DiGraph -showCanvas]) and ([DiGraph
	-hideCanvas]) to allow dynamic showing and hiding of a DiGraph as
	simulation runs.

1997-12-12  Marcus G. Daniels  <mgd@wijiji.santafe.edu>

	* DiGraphNode.m ([DiGraphNode -setNodeLabel:aLabel]): Constify
	argument.

	* DiGraphNode.h (DiGraphNode): Constify label.
	Constify argument to setNodeLabel.

	* Makefile (SWARMHOME): Don't define if already defined in
	environment.

	* DiGraphNode.m: Switch from #include to #import for tkobjc.h
	and simtools.h.

	* DiGraph.m: Switch from #include to #import for tkobjc.h and
	simtools.h.
	([DiGraph -boingStep]): Initialize n to 0 to avoid warning.
