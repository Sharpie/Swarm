	* Nhood2dCounter.h: new method 
	- (BOOL)checkVisibilityX: (uns)x Y: (uns)y

2005-02-11  Paul Johnson  <pauljohn@pols111.pols.ku.edu>

	* Output.h: New class, for the GUI and batch output

2003-03-17  Paul E. Johnson  <pauljohn@pjdell.pols.ukans.edu>

	* SchellingWorld.m: SchellingWorld is both a grid where agents
	exist as well as a set of calculating mechanisms that track the
	number of visible agents of each race within a neighborhood.
	Note nhoodMask variable can be customized to shape a neighborhood.

	* ModelSwarm.m ([ModelSwarm +createBegin:]): played with parameters.

2003-03-12  Paul E. Johnson  <pauljohn@pjdell.pols.ukans.edu>

	* Person.m ([Person -step]): 
	 adopt this: if( myTolerance < 1.0 - [self getFractionOf: myColor] )
  
         instead of this: if( myTolerance <  [self getFractionOf: ((myColor==0)?1:0)] )
	

	* ObserverSwarm.m: revise colormap, so low values represent agent types.

	* ModelSwarm.m ([ModelSwarm -buildObjects]): allow for N
	races. change colors to 0,1...

2003-03-11  Paul E. Johnson  <pauljohn@pjdell.pols.ukans.edu>

	* DiscreteToroid.h: add method declarations that
	were missing.

	* ObserverSwarm.m: reformat throughout

	* Neighborhood.m: Deleted this class

	* Person.m ([-getFractionOf:]): fix calculation of fraction 
	([Person -createEnd]): new method

	* Person.m: Eliminate Neighborhood class, redesign agents accordingly.

	* ModelSwarm.m: reformatting

2003-02-13  Paul E Johnson  <pauljohn@ukans.edu>

	* ModelSwarm.m ([ModelSwarm -stepThroughList]): New method to step through agents,
	possibly in a shuffled order.
	([ModelSwarm -randomizeList]): new method to turn on and off randomized processing
	of the list. The probeLibrary has had this method added above.

	* ObserverSwarm.m: window geometry archiving

	* main.m (main): window geometry archiving
