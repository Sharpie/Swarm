	(*objc-to-java-type-alist*): Regular express alist of type
	conversion rules.
	(*last-protocol*, *stub-directory*): New variables.

	patterns as ^$ wrappedregular expressions.
	(java-protocol-creatable-p): Use find instead of loop.
	(java-print, freakyp): New functions.
	(java-print-type): Print a message when freaky types are seen.
