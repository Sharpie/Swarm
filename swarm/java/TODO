String conversion from MessageProbes will leak memory -- it's entered
in the directory and points to strdupped stuff on the heap. [mgd]

Add either stubbing for string array conversions (e.g. Histogram) or
add alternative interfaces that use objects.

Write and integrate a runtime query program to determine IMP functions
for Java stubs; eliminate method dispatch overhead.

javacswarm and javaswarm grab jdkdatadir which isn't inverted back
to SWARMROOT.  For 2.0.1, I've edited it by hand.
