String conversion from MessageProbes will leak memory -- it's entered
in the directory and points to strdupped stuff on the heap. [mgd]

Add either stubbing for string array conversions (e.g. Histogram) or
add alternative interfaces that use objects.

Write and integrate a runtime query program to determine IMP functions
for Java stubs; eliminate method dispatch overhead.
