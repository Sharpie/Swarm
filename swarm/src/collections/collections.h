//S: Standard collection types

//D: The collections library follows the library interface conventions of
//D: the defobj library.  It also depends on standard supertypes and
//D: classes defined by this library.  Initialization of the collections
//D: library automatically initializes the defobj library as well.  Since
//D: defobj also requires the collections library, both must always be
//D: linked into an application together.

@protocol Offsets 
//S: Methods for accessing collection members by position.

//D: An offset is an integer value that gives relative position of a member
//D: in the enumeration sequence of a collection.  Offsets start the count
//D: of the first member at zero, just like C array indexing.

//D: Offsets provide an alternate means to access the members of a
//D: collection, without creating a separate index object.  Some collection
//D: subtypes (such as Array) support fast, direct access by integer member
//D: offset, while others support member offsets only as a shorthand for
//D: sequential access through every preceding member.  Access by offsets
//D: is supported on all collections regardless of whether its speed on a
//D: particular collection type.

//D: atOffset: and atOffset:put: raise the error OffsetOutOfRange if the
//D: offset is greater than or equal to the count of members in the collection.

USING
//M: Returns the member at a particular member offset.

//M: The atOffset: put: message replaces the member at a particular offset
//M: with a new value, and returns the previous member value at this offset.

- getFirst;

//M: Equivalent to [aCollection atOffset: [aCollection getCount] - 1].

@protocol ForEach
//S: Messages for performing the same message on objects in a collection.

//D: The forEach messages supply a convenient shorthand for repeatedly
//D: performing the same message on all objects contained as members in a
//D: collection.  The message to be sent is identified by the argument
//D: aSelector.  This selector must define the same number of arguments as
//D: contained in any remaining argument slots of the forEach message.  The
//D: argument types of the message to be sent must be either the id type,
//D: or some other type that will fit in the same number of bits as the id
//D: type.  By global portability assumptions, the argument type could be
//D: as large as an int (signed or unsigned), but not necessarily as large
//D: as a long.  To use the message, any non-id value must be cast to the
//D: id type as part of the call expression.

//D: The forEach: messages are implemented by a simple loop through all
//D: members of a collection, using an internal, temporary index.  If any
//D: operation more complex than a simple message send is required, this
//D: operation should just be coded directly using a loop that traverses
//D: its own index.

@protocol Collection <Create, SetInitialValue, Copy, Drop, Offsets, ForEach>
//S: A generic collection interface.

//D: A collection is a grouping of object references or other data values which
//D: are assigned explicitly as members of the collection.  Depending on the
//D: subtype, collection members may also be maintained in various associations
//D: with each other, such as an ordering of members or an association of
//D: members with identifying key values.  Major Collection subtypes include
//D: Array, List, Set and Map.  The Collection supertype establishes common
//D: conventions (and associated messages) supported by all types of
//D: collections.

//D: All collections support traversal over their members using a separate
//D: object called an Index.  All collections also follow common rules
//D: regarding the types of data values which may be added as members.  The
//D: next two subsections summarize these basic features of all collections.

//D: An index is a special type of object that references a current
//D: position in an enumeration sequence over a collection.  An enumeration
//D: sequence contains every member of a collection exactly once.  Every
//D: collection defines an associated type of object for its index.  The
//D: index type of a collection defines additional ways in which the
//D: members of a collection may be processed beyond any messages available
//D: directly on the collection.  Often the operations of an index provide
//D: the most basic and flexible means for manipulating individual members
//D: of a collection.

//D: An index object into a collection may be created at any time.  An
//D: index is the basic means to traverse through all members of a
//D: collection.  Multiple indexes on the same collection may all exist at
//D: the same time and may reference the same or different positions.
//D: Depending on the collection type, it may be possible to modify a
//D: collection through its indexes.

//D: Once an index is created, the sequence of members in its enumeration
//D: sequence is guaranteed to remain the same, provided that no new
//D: members are added to the underlying collection, or existing members
//D: removed.  If a member is located once at a particular position, it is
//D: guaranteed to remain at that position as long as the index itself
//D: remains.

//D: Many collection types define an explicit ordering over their members.
//D: For such collections, the sequence of members referred to by an index
//D: will always be consistent with this ordering.  An explicit, total
//D: ordering also guarantees that all indexes of the same collection have
//D: the same member sequence.

//D: If no such ordering is defined, however, some particular sequence of
//D: all the collection still becomes associated with each created index.
//D: All collection members are guaranteed to be contained somewhere in the
//D: enumeration sequence for any particular index, but two indexes on the
//D: same collection are not guaranteed to have the same sequence.

//D: The Index type corresponds to the iterator types defined as part of
//D: many other object-oriented libraries.  The name Index is shorter and
//D: emphasizes the more abstract and multi-function role of these basic
//D: support objects for any collection.  For more background on design of
//D: indexes and iterators, see the Interface Design Notes for the
//D: collections library.

CREATING
//M: This boolean-valued option restricts valid usage of a collection by
//M: excluding all operations which add or remove members.  For some
//M: collection subtypes, a replace-only restriction can obtain many of the
//M: same performance advantages as a read-only collection, but without
//M: disabling replace operations as well.  Just like the ReadOnly option,
//M: the ReplaceOnly option may be reset after a collection is created,
//M: provided it was not originally set to true.
- (void)setReplaceOnly: (BOOL)replaceOnly;

- (void)setIndexFromMemberLoc: (int)byteOffset;

USING
//M: Note: copies are shallow; members inside the collection are not copied.
- copy: aZone;

- (BOOL)getReplaceOnly;

//M: getCount returns the integer number of members currently contained in
//M: the collection.  All collections maintain their count internally so
//M: that no traversal of collection members is required simply to return
//M: this value.
- (unsigned)getCount;

//M: The contains: message returns true if the collection contains any
//M: member value which matches the value passed as its argument.
//M: Depending on the collection subtype, this may require traversing
//M: sequentially through all members of the collection until a matching
//M: member is found.  For other subtypes, some form of direct indexing
//M: from the member value may be supported.  The message is supported
//M: regardless of its speed.
- (BOOL)contains: aMember;

//M: The remove: message removes the first member in the collection with a
//M: value matching the value passed as its argument.  If there is no such
//M: member, a nil value is returned.  As with the contains: message, the
//M: speed of this operation may vary from very low to linear in the number
//M: of members, depending on the collection subtype.
- remove: aMember;

//M: The removeAll message removes all existing members of a collection and
//M: sets its member count to zero.  The collection then remains valid for
//M: further members to be added.  This message has no effect on the
//M: objects which might be referenced by any removed member values.  If
//M: resources consumed by these objects also need to be released, such
//M: release operations (such as drop messages) can be performed prior to
//M: removing the member values.
- (void)removeAll;

//M: Like removeAll:, but drops the member(s) as well.
- (void)deleteAll;

//M: Returns YES if all members are of the same class.

//M: traversing the elements of a collection.  All further information
//M: about indexes is documented under the Index type.

@protocol Index <DefinedObject, Drop>
//S: Reference into the enumeration sequence for a collection.

//D: An index is a reference into an enumeration sequence of a collection.
//D: Such an enumeration sequence contains all members of the collection in
//D: some order.  This order will always be consistent with ordering of
//D: members in the collection, assuming there is such an ordering.
//D: Otherwise, the sequence will still contain all members in some order
//D: that remains fixed provided that new members are not added or removed
//D: from the collection.

//D: An index is created by a begin: or createIndex: message against a
//D: collection.  Each major collection type has its own corresponding
//D: index type, which supports specialized types of processing against
//D: the valid contents of that kind of collection.  Once created, an
//D: index is a separate object from the collection itself, but it remains
//D: valid only so long as the collection itself still exists.  Multiple
//D: indexes may exist at the same time against the same collection, and
//D: each index maintains its own position within an enumeration sequence
//D: for the collection.

//D: Many indexes provde the ability modify the collection they refer
//D: to, in addition to simply traversing members.  An index often provides
//D: the complete means for maintaining the contents of a collection, more than
//D: could otherwise be performed on the collection itself.  The position or
//D: other status of the index is automatically updated to reflect any changes
//D: made through the index itself.

//D: If changes to a collection are made while other indexes exist, those
//D: other indexes could be affected in potentially catastrophic ways.
//D: Each collection type documents which kinds of changes can be made
//D: without affecting or invalidating existing indexes.  The IndexSafety
//D: option of Collection provides additional ways to protect indexes
//D: against possible effects of independent updates.

//D: Each index is a stand-alone object allocated within a zone passed as
//D: an argument in the message that created it.  This zone need not match
//D: the zone of a collection.  It is common for index lifetimes to be
//D: shorter than their collection.  For example, indexes can be created in
//D: a temporary scratch zone for use only within a local loop.

//D: Because messages to a collection are the only valid way to create an
//D: index, create messages and create-time options are not used with index
//D: types.  All valid processing on an index is determined by
//D: characteristics of the collection from which it is created.  Index
//D: types are typically named after the type of collection they are
//D: created from, and serve principally to define the specific messages
//D: valid for an index on that type of collection.

//D: Index objects support the universal messages of the top-level
//D: DefinedObject supertype, along with the standard drop: and getZone
//D: messages.  Even though they cannot be created except from a
//D: collection, new index objects can be created from an existing index
//D: using the standard copy: message.  Each copy refers to the same
//D: collection as the initial index, and starts at the same position in
//D: its enumeration sequence.  In all other respects, however, the new
//D: copy is an independent index that maintains its own position under any
//D: further processing.

USING
//M: getCollection returns the collection referred to by an index.  This
//M: collection never changes during the lifetime of the index.
- getCollection;

//M: The next message positions the index to the next valid member
//M: after its current position, or to a special position after the
//M: end of all valid members.  In addition to
//M: repositioning the index, both messages return the new member value to
//M: which they are positioned, or nil if there is no such member.
- next;

//M: The prev message works similarly,
//M: but positions to a valid member preceding the current position, or to
//M: a special position preceding all valid members. 
- prev;

//M: findNext: repeatedly performs next until the member value of the
//M: index matches the argument.  nil is returned if the index reaches
//M: the end of valid members without matching the argument.  
- findNext: anObject;

//M: findPrev: repeatedly performs prev until the member value of the
//M: index matches the argument.  nil is returned if the index reaches
//M: the end of valid members without matching the argument. 
- findPrev: anObject;

//M: get returns the member value at which the index is currently
//M: positioned, or nil if the index is not positioned at a member.

//M: The get message provides an alternate way to obtain the current member
//M: value in a loop that traverses a collection; its return value is the
//M: same as next or prev would return when first positioning to a new
//M: member.
- get;

//M: The put: message replaces the member value at the current index
//M: position with its argument.  An InvalidIndexLoc error is raised if
//M: the index is not positioned at a current member.
- put: anObject;

//M: The remove message removes the member at the current location of an
//M: index, and returns the member value removed.  The index position is
//M: set to a special position between the members which previously
//M: preceded and followed the removed member.  If there is no preceding or
//M: following member, the index is set to the special location before the
//M: start or after the end of all members.  After a current member is
//M: removed, there is no member at the current index location, but a
//M: subsequent next or prev message will continue with the same member
//M: that would have been accessed had the current member not been removed.
//M: An InvalidIndexLoc error is raised if the index is not positioned
//M: at a current member.
- remove;

//M: The getLoc message returns a symbol constant which indicates the type
//M: of location at which an index is currently positioned.  This index
//M: location symbol has one of the following values: Start, End, 
#if 0
//M: Between,
#endif
//M: and Member.

//M: The Start symbol indicates the special position preceding all members
//M: in the enumeration sequence for the collection.  This is the location
//M: at which an index is positioned when it is first created.  The End
//M: symbol indicates the special position following all members in the
//M: collection.  This is the location at which an index is positioned just
//M: after a next message has returned nil, as a result of moving beyond
//M: the last member.   The Member symbol indicates that the index
//M: is positioned at some current member in the enumeration sequence
//M: of a collection.
#if 0
//M: The Between symbol indicates the special position
//M: between two other members, at which an index is positioned after a
//M: current member, between two other members, is removed. 
#endif

//M: The getLoc message is needed to traverse a collection which could
//M: contain nil values for its members.  Without getLoc, there would be no
//M: way to distinguish a nil value returned by next as either a valid
//M: member value or the special value returned at the end of members.
//M: With getLoc, a loop that traverses a collection can test specifically
//M: for the end (or start) of members.

//E: Following is a simple loop which illustrates such usage:

//E: {
//E:   id <Index> index = [aCollection begin: aZone];
//E:   id member;
//E:
//E:   for (member = [index next]; [index getLoc] == Member; member = [index next])
//E:     {
//E:      // do something with member ...
//E:     }
//E:   [index drop];
//E: }
- (id <Symbol>)getLoc;

//M: The setLoc: message may be used to reset the current location of an
//M: index to either Start or End.  It may be used to reprocess a
//M: collection using an existing index after some other location has
//M: already been reached.  It may also be used to position an index at the
//M: end of all members prior to traversing members in reverse order using
//M: prev.

//M: Besides Start and End, setLoc: accepts the special argument values of
//M: BetweenAfter and BetweenBefore, which are also defined symbols.  These
//M: argument values are only valid if the index is positioned at a current
//M: member.  They reposition the index to the special location between the
//M: current member and its immediately following or preceding member.
- (void)setLoc: (id <Symbol>)locSymbol;

//M: Provided there is no major computational cost, an index also maintains
//M: the integer offset of its current member within the enumeration
//M: sequence of the collection.  These integer offset values have the same
//M: definition as in the atOffset: messages of Collection.  The getOffset
//M: message returns this current offset value.  If the index is current
//M: positioned at the Start or End location, getOffset returns -1.  If the
//M: index is positioned at a Between location, getOffset returns the
//M: offset of the immediately preceding member.  If the offset is not
//M: currently available from the index, getOffset returns the special
//M: value UnknownOffset.  This value is defined by a macro as the
//M: maximally negative value of a 32-bit, 2's-complement integer.

//M: An offset is always available from an index if its current position
//M: has been reached by repeated operations from an initial Start or End
//M: position, and there has been no other modification to the underlying
//M: collection.  Some forms of direct member access operations supported
//M: by some index types, however, may result in an integer offset not
//M: being available.  These restrictions are noted with the individual
//M: index type.
- (int)getOffset;

//M: Using the setOffset: message, an index may be positioned directly to a
//M: member using the offset of the member within its enumeration sequence.
//M: The speed of this operation depends on the specific type of the
//M: collection, just as noted for the atOffset: message on Collection.  In
//M: the worst case, this operation is linear in the magnitude of the
//M: offset.
- setOffset: (unsigned)offset;

//M: The compare: message compares the current location of one index with
//M: the current location of another index passed as its argument.  If the
//M: two indexes have the same location, compare: returns zero.  Otherwise,
//M: compare: returns +1 or -1 according to whether the argument index
//M: precedes or follows the receiver index in the enumeration sequence of
//M: the collection.  If either of the two indexes has an unknown offset,
//M: and the location of the other index is anything other than Start or
//M: End or an immediately adjacent member, compare: returns the
//M: UnknownOffset integer value.

@protocol MemberBlock
//S: A way to wrap an existing C array for access as an object collection.

//D: This option provides a means to wrap an existing C array for access as
//D: an object collection.  If this option is given, dynamic resizing is
//D: not supported.  The current C array being wrapped, however, can be
//D: replaced by giving a new setting for MemberBlock after an array
//D: already exists.  A new setting can be given only if some setting was
//D: initially given at create time.

//D: Even if a setting was not given for MemberBlock at create time, the
//D: get message for MemberBlock always returns a pointer to whatever
//D: internal memory array is currently being used by the array object.  If
//D: a MemberBlock setting was given, the pointer returned will be the same
//D: as the one previously given.  In either case, the pointer returned may
//D: be used to manipulate member values in any way desired using native C
//D: expressions.  After an array has been created, there is no way to
//D: determine whether the MemberBlock pointer was established externally
//D: or by internal allocation.  If the pointer was established by internal
//D: allocation, however, the external program must make no attempt to free
//D: or otherwise reallocate this memory.

//D: A count must always be supplied with an external member allocation,
//D: using the setCount: argument of the compound message.  If an external
//D: allocation is being used, the only way to reset the count is also to
//D: reset MemberBlock; any attempt to use the setCount: message by itself
//D: will raise an error.  Whenever an external member allocation is being
//D: used, the external program is entirely responsible for assuring that
//D: the MemberBlock value is a pointer to valid allocated memory
//D: containing at least the number of member slots given by setCount:.

//D: With an external member allocation, the array itself will not attempt
//D: to either allocate this memory or free it when the array is dropped.
//D: Dropping the array only removes its reference to the external
//D: allocation.

//D: Since an array neither allocates nor frees an external member
//D: allocation, the same region of allocated memory may be referenced by
//D: multiple arrays, including overlapping member ranges each defined by

@protocol Array <Collection, CREATABLE, DefaultMember, MemberBlock>
//S: Collection supporting access only by relative position.

//D: An array is a collection of members that are all created as members of
//D: the collection at the same time.  Existing member values may be
//D: replaced with new values, but the members themselves are fixed at
//D: constant offsets within the collection.  The fixed structure of an
//D: array permits very fast access to members by integer offset positions,
//D: since the location of each member may be directly calculated.

//D: The Array type is one of the simplest collection types in the
//D: collections library, and the closest to a data structure directly
//D: supported in C.  Unlike C arrays, the group of members belonging to
//D: the array is not necessarily fixed for the lifetime of the array, but
//D: may be dynamically resized to contain a different number of members.
//D: When an array is dynamically resized, existing member values are
//D: preserved as much as possible.

//D: The Array type adds few messages to the generic messages inherited
//D: from Collection.  This type is provided partly so that a
//D: fixed-structure array can be accessed with the same uniform set of
//D: basic messages as any other kind of object collection.  It also
//D: handles all required memory allocation within the collection.  As an
//D: option, however, the Array type can be used to wrap an existing C
//D: array for external access as an object collection.  It can also
//D: provide access to an internal C array for direct manipulation using C
//D: expressions.  These forms of low-level access support hybrid modes of
//D: use in which advantages of both low-level manipulation and external
//D: object access can be combined.

//D: The Array type is directly creatable, and supports all standard
//D: messages of Collection except removal of individual members.  The
//D: messages based on an integer offset, either on the collection
//D: (atOffset:, atOffset:put:), or an index (setOffset:) all execute in
//D: fast constant time.  Members of an array are fully ordered according
//D: to these integer offsets.  Sequential access to members through its
//D: members is also fully supported.  The Array type disables the remove
//D: message inherited from Collection; the message is defined, but any
//D: attempt to remove a member will raise an error that the operation is
//D: not supported.

//D: While the IndexSafety option of an Array defaults to Unsafe, indexes
//D: are inherently safe under all operations with the exception of
//D: resizing an array or resetting its member allocation.  (The only
//D: individual member operation which modifies contents of an array is
//D: replacing a member value, and this does not affect existing indexes.)
//D: The UnsafeAtMember value of IndexSafety is not supported since
//D: individual members cannot be added or removed.  A value of SafeAlways
//D: makes existing indexes safe even under resizing or reallocation.  If
//D: an existing index referred to a member location that is no longer
//D: contained in the array, the index location is reset to the End
//D: location.

//D: The default value of the ReplaceOnly option is true, and cannot be
//D: overridden.

//D: The type of index returned by begin: on an array is simply Index.
//D: There is no special index type for Array because there are no
//D: additional messages beyond those already defined by Index.

//D: All the Array create-time options can also be set after the array is
//D: already created, subject to restrictions noted below.

@protocol List <Collection, CREATABLE>
//S:  Collection of members in an externally assigned linear sequence.

//D: A list is a collection of members that are all maintained at some

//D: sequence is established by the position at which members are added:
//D: members can be added at the start of list, at the end, or at any point
//D: in the middle.

//D: A list is also one of the most dynamic of basic collections, in that
//D: the cost of adding and removing members is very low.  Members can be
//D: removed from any position just as easily as they can be added.  A list
//D: automatically grows and shrinks to reflect the number of members at
//D: any one time, and there is no fixed capacity which limits the size to
//D: which a list may grow.

//D: The List type is supports all messages of Collection.  If created with
//D: default options, it provides no special speedup of accesses by integer
//D: offset.

//D: Unless the EndsOnly option is specified, the default value of
//D: IndexSafety is UnsafeAtMember.  This means that indexes are inherently
//D: safe under all operations except those which affect the member at an
//D: index or immediately adjacent to an index between members.  If the
//D: EndsOnly option is specified, the default value of IndexSafety is
//D: Unsafe.  In this case, indexes could be invalidated by any operation

//D: The addAfter: and addBefore: messages add members at a particular
//D: point in the sequence of members maintained by a list.  The current
//D: location of an index determines the point at which a new member will
//D: be added.  The addAfter: message adds a member at the list position
//D: immediately following the current index location.  addBefore: adds a
//D: member to the immediately preceding location.  Neither message changes
//D: the current location of the index, except that an index can change
//D: from a Start or End location to a location of Between.

//D: Since an index may be positioned to any location in a list, these
//D: messages enable the construction of any desired sequence of members.
//D: Since the current index location remains unchanged, multiple members
//D: may all be inserted successively at some point in a list; previously
//D: added members are just pushed out one-by-one as new members are added.

//D: An index with a location of Start, End, or Between is just as valid a
//D: location for addAfter: or addBefore: as an index positioned at a
//D: member.  In these cases, there is no member at the current location of
//D: the index, so the new member is just inserted directly at the current
//D: index location, and the index is left positioned between the new
//D: member and the member that was previously adjacent in the opposite
//D: direction.  If the previous location was Start and the message
//D: addAfter:, or the location was End and the message addBefore:, the
//D: index location remains Start or End.

//D: If either the addAfter: or addBefore: message is requested with the
//D: EndsOnly option, and the index location is not Start or End, or
//D: if remove is requested on an index that is not positioned at either the
//D: first or last member, an invalid operation error is raised.

@protocol CompareFunction
//S: Interface for defining the compare function to use when comparing
//S: to members in a collection.

//D: The function given will be called whenever one key value needs to be
//D: compared with another.  Multiple calls to the function typically occur
//D: whenever members are added or removed from the collection, until the
//D: correct member for insertion or removal is determined.

//D: The compare function is called repeatedly by the collection to compare
//D: two key values.  The function should return zero if the key values are
//D: equal, -1 for the first key argument less than the second, and +1 for
//D: the first greater than the second.  If a keyed collection is not
//D: sorted, either -1 or +1 may be returned for unequal keys, regardless
//D: of whether one might be taken as greater or less than the other.

//T: The compare function accepts two key values as its arguments.  Like
//T: member types, key types declared with the id pointer type, but may
//T: contain any type of value (such as an integer) up to the size of an
//T: id.  An explicit compare function can support any type of value as a
//T: key, regardless of whether it is an object that supports a standard
//T: compare: message.

@protocol KeyedCollection <Collection>
//S: Member identity definition shared by Set and Map types.

//D: A keyed collection is a collection in which each member can be

//D: either by the member value itself, which defines a Set, or by external
//D: association with the member when the member is first added, which
//D: defines a Map.

//D: The KeyedCollection type inherits all standard behavior of Collection.
//D: The KeyedCollection type is not itself creatable; it only serves as a
//D: common supertype for Set and Map collection types.

//D: The keyed collection type establishes the common behavior shared by

@protocol KeyedCollectionIndex <Index>
//S: Index behavior shared by Set and Map types.

//D: An index to a keyed collection traverses all members of the

//D: an index keeps track of any specific subcollection it is currently

@protocol MemberSlot
//S: Allocation in member/key for fast setMember:/setKey:

//D: The MemberSlot option indicates that space has been reserved within
//D: each member that allows it to contain a link directly to its position
//D: in the enumeration for a collection.  If such space has been reserved,
//D: special messages can be used that rapidly position an index directly
//D: to the member.  Operations to remove members are also much faster.

//D: The value of MemberSlot specifies the offset in bytes from the start
//D: of each member where the space for its position link has been
//D: reserved.  

//D: The offset of the position link from the start of a member may be
//D: either positive or negative, in the range of -2048 to +2047.  The
//D: default value of MemberSlot is UnknownOffset (a large negative value),
//D: which specifies that no slot for an internal position link is
//D: available within each member.

//T: This type declares the required space for a position link in a
//T: collection that does not accept duplicate key values.

//T: If a member slot is defined, a memory pointer of some kind must always
//T: be used for the value of every member.  These members may be object id
//T: pointers, but other types of memory pointers are acceptable as well.

//T: The contents of the first two words of position link vary according to
//T: the position of a member in a collection. 
typedef struct memberData { void *memberData[2]; } member_t;

//T: The third word of a
//T: dupmember_t link contains the id of the collection in which a member
//T: is directly contained.  This collection is either an internally
//T: created collection containing members with duplicate keys, or the
//T: collection to which the member was added if there is no other member
//T: with the same key.

@protocol Set <KeyedCollection, CREATABLE>
//S: Collection of members each having a defined identity.

//D: Set is a subtype of KeyedCollection in which the key value associated
//D: with each member is determined by the member value itself.  The key
//D: value may be identical to the member itself, or may be defined as a a
//D: function of the member using a create-time option.

//D: The Set type inherits most of its interface from the KeyedCollection
//D: supertype.  Set defines no create-time options beyond those already
//D: defined by KeyedCollection.  If a custom compare or bucket function is
//D: specified, the member value is passed as the key value arguments of
//D: these functions.  These functions determine what part of the member
//D: value is part of the key value, by determining which key values will
//D: compare equal to any member.

// - (BOOL)add: anObject setIndex: anIndex;

//M: The replace: message replaces a member stored at a given key with
//M: another member value that matches the same key.  The new value to

//M: the member value that was replaced, or nil if the collection contained
//M: no member with a matching key.

@protocol OrderedSet <List, CREATABLE>
//S: A set of members in an externally assigned linear sequence.

//D: An OrderedSet is a totally ordered collection of members in which every
//D: member also has a distinct identity as defined by comparison against
//D: a key value.

//D: (.. This type is currently implemented only using the low-level option
//D: of an internal member slot, and the messages for that option do not
//D: match the documentation in KeyedCollection.  If you need one of these
//D: objects, then either use a List or wait for some other
//D: implementation.)

//D: The sequence of members of an OrderedSet is established using the same
//D: messages that maintain member sequence in a List.  An OrderedSet
//D: supports customization and access by key as defined by Set and
//D: KeyedCollection.  The union of messages from all these sources defines
//D: the total interface of an OrderedSet.  Members with duplicate keys,
//D: however, are not valid for an OrderedSet.  Each member must have a
//D: unique position within the member sequence
@end

@protocol Map <KeyedCollection, CompareFunction, CREATABLE>
//S: Collection of associations from key objects to member objects.

//D: Map is a subtype of KeyedCollection in which the key value associated
//D: with each member is independent of the member itself.  Whenever a new
//D: member is added to the collection, a key value to be associated with
//D: the member must be supplied also.  A Map defines a mapping from key
//D: values to member values.

//D: For the Map type, key values are independent of the member values with
//D: which they are associated.  Map defines two additional options to
//D: document information about its key values.  Map also defines its own
//D: messages to distinguish the key value from member value in any
//D: operation which involves both.

USING
//M: at:insert: inserts an entry into a Map containing the key and member
//M: values given as its arguments.  It returns true if the key was not
//M: previously contained in the collection.  An attempt to insert a
