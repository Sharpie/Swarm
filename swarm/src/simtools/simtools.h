@protocol UName <SwarmObject, CREATABLE>
//S: A class used to generate unique names (e.g. "critter1", "critter2" etc.)

//D: This class is used to generate unique names (agent0, agent1,
//D: agent2...) for objects in a simulation. The user will typically create
//D: an instance of the UName class initialized with a baseName presented
//D: either as a (const char *) or an object of class String. The user can
//D: then request new names, again either as (const char *)'s or as
//D: instances of the String class. The user can also reset the counter
//D: used to generate the names in case s/he wants to restart naming
//D: objects with the same baseName.

//D: Note: Both in the case of initialization by (const char *) and
//D: initialization by an instance of the String class, the original is
//D: copied not stored internally so it is up to the user to free the
//D: original (const char *) or String instance if/when necessary!

@protocol InFile <SwarmObject, CREATABLE>
//S: Class to perform file input.
