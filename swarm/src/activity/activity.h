Name:         activity.h
Description:  processing control over all levels of swarm execution 
Library:      activity
*/

//S: Processing control over all levels of Swarm execution

//D: The activity library is responsible for scheduling actions to occur
//D: within a simulated world, and for making these actions actually happen
//D: at the right time in the right order.  It provides the foundation of
//D: dynamic, object-oriented simulation within Swarm.

//D: Actions consist of messages to objects, calls to functions, or groups
//D: of actions in some defined order.  The activity library guarantees
//D: that all these actions, and the state changes they produce, occur at
//D: predictable points in time.  Time is defined by the relative order of
//D: actions, and may also be indexed by the discrete values of a world
//D: clock.

#import <collections.h>
#include <externvar.h>

@protocol DefaultOrder
//S: The DefaultOrder option indicates the ordering to be assumed among
//S: actions of the plan when no other explicit ordering has been assigned.

//D: The DefaultOrder option indicates the ordering to be assumed among
//D: actions of the plan when no other explicit ordering has been assigned.
//D: Beyond this initial ordering, additional ordering constraints can be
//D: added selectively using partial order specifications on individual
//D: actions.  (.. Partial order order constraints are not yet
//D: implemented.)

//D: The value for DefaultOrder is a symbol that may have one of the
//D: following values: Concurrent, Sequential, Randomized;

//D: The Concurrent value of the DefaultOrder option indicates that can
//D: actions be run in any order (including at the same time, if hardware
//D: and software to do this is available) without no impact on the net
//D: outcome of the actions.  The claim that action results are independent
//D: of their execution order gives the processing machinery explicit
//D: leeway to execute them in any order it chooses.  In the current
//D: implementation on a single, serial processor, actions are always
//D: processed sequentially even if marked concurrent, because that is the
//D: only way they can be.  In future versions, however, special runtime
//D: processing modes may be defined even for a serial processor, which
//D: would mix up execution order just to confirm the independence of model
//D: results.

//D: The Sequential value for the DefaultOrder option is the default.  It
//D: specifies that the actions must always be executed in the same order
//D: as they occur in the plan.  This order is ordinarily the same order in
//D: which actions are first created in the plan, unless actions are
//D: explicitly added elsewhere the collection that underlies a plan.  This
//D: option is always the safest to assure predictability of results, but
//D: it excludes the ability to run the actions in parallel.  To better
//D: understand and document a model design, it is worth annotating action
//D: plans with an explicit indication as to whether they do or do not
//D: depend on a Sequential order.

//D: The Randomized value for the DefaultOrder option specifies that the
//D: model results do depend on execution order, but that the order in
//D: which the actions were created or added has no special significance.
//D: Instead, the method of dealing with order dependence is to generate a
//D: random order each time a collection of same-time actions is processed.
//D: The random order will be generated from an random number generator
//D: internal to the processing machinery.

@protocol Activity <DefinedObject, Drop, RETURNABLE>
//S: A level of processing by the interpreter of an action type.

//D: A object of type Activity implements the processing of actions within
//D: an action plan.  Each subtype of action plan has a corresponding
//D: subtype of Activity that implements processing of its respective type
//D: of plan.

//D: The Activity types are part of the virtual processing machinery of an
//D: action plan interpreter.  All the important elements of this
//D: machinery, including their current state of processing, are exposed to
//D: aid in development of general-purpose tools such as debuggers.  Except
//D: for applications that need to create and run their own reflective
//D: activities, direct use of activity types by a modeling application
//D: should be rare.

//D: A new activity object is created by each activateIn: message sent to
//D: an action type.  activateIn: initializes a new activity object and
//D: prepares it for processing, but does not itself execute any actions.
//D: Subsequent messages, such as run, must be used to initiate processing
//D: within an activity.  If an activity is activated to run under a swarm
//D: context, the owning swarm itself controls all processing within the
//D: subactivity.

//D: An Activity type holds a tree of currently running, or a potentially
//D: runnable, subactivities.  Each activity object represents a state of
//D: processing within a single action plan.  The structure is a tree
//D: because multiple activities could be running or eligible to run at the
//D: same time.  This occurs whenever two activities are specified as
//D: concurrent, either because are being performed by concurrent actions
//D: in some other plan, or because they were started for autonomous
//D: execution under the same swarm.  When parallel processing machinery is
//D: present, each activity could also be advancing its own state
//D: independent of those of any other activity.

//D: The current implementation supports only a single serial processor.
//D: Under serial execution, only one activity may be active at one time.
//D: This means that the current state of processing may be represented by
//D: a single stack of current activities that traces a path to a single
//D: leaf of the runnable activity tree.  When running in serial mode,
//D: messages are available to obtain the currently running leaf activity
//D: or useful context information such as the current time available from it.

USING
//M: The run message continue processing of an activity from any state in
//M: which its execution has been suspended.  An error is raised if the
//M: activity is already running.  run returns either a Stopped or
//M: Completed status that the activity has when it is no longer eligible
//M: to be run further.

//M: stops a running tree of activities, but sets all activities within the
//M: tree to a status of Completed whenever the tree is next run.
//M: terminate may be used on either a running or stopped tree of
//M: activities.  It is the standard way to terminate schedule that is
//M: endlessly repeating under the RepeatInterval option.

@protocol Action <Create, Drop, GetOwner>
//S: An action type that has been customized for direct execution by an
//S: action interpreter.

//D: Action is a common supertype of all action types which may be created
//D: within an action plan.  Each action is always controlled by a single
//D: action plan to which it belongs.  This action plan is referred to as
//D: its owner.  Given the action object, its owner plan may be obtained
//D: using the inherited getOwner message.

//D: Actions are allocated in the same zone as their owner plan, and may be
//D: created only using one of the createAction messages on an ActionGroup
//D: or Schedule.  Each of these messages returns the action that was
//D: created as its return value.  Actions in an action plan may also be
//D: obtained by processing the plan using any of its messages inherited
//D: from its underlying collection.  Actions may also be removed from an
//D: action plan using a remove message on the underlying collection.

//D: (.. Note: currently, an action cannot be removed while it is currently
//D: being executed.  This means that the function or message called by an
//D: action cannot itself remove that same action from its action plan.
//D: This restriction will be removed in the future.)

//D: Separate subtypes of Action are defined for each of the various forms
//D: of createAction messages that create them.  The current representation
//D: of these actions will be undergoing change as support for their
//D: parameter and return types is migrated into more basic support from
//D: the defobj library.  Each action type provides messages to retrieve
//D: and set the values of all argument values bound into the action.
//D: These capabilities will remain, but different messages will

//D: Externally initiated interaction typically occurs only at the start or

//D: Some actions may also have internal events that cannot begin or
//D: complete until other actions from a containing environment have also
//D: begun or completed their execution.  Such ordering constraints can be
//D: defined either within an action type or as part of a dynamic context
//D: of execution.

//D: (such as C functions or Objective C messages) and compound actions
//D: built at runtime for interpretation by the Swarm abstract machine.

//S: Handle actions scheduled at same time value.

//D: The ConcurrentGroupType option is used to control handling of multiple
//D: actions which end up being scheduled at the same time value.  As far
//D: the schedule representation is concerned, these actions are assumed by
//D: default to be concurrently executable, and the processing machinery is
//D: free to process them as such if no ConcurrentGroupType option is
//D: specified.

//D: If a different interpretation of actions at the same time step is
//D: needed, the ConcurrentGroupType option may be specified.  The argument
//D: of this option must be an object that when given a standard create:
//D: message will return an object having all the structure of a standard
//D: ActionGroup object.

//D: In addition to overriding the standard ActionGroup type, the
//D: concurrent group type may be implemented by a custom subclass of the
//D: ActionGroup implementation which you supply yourself.  A custom
//D: subclass is free to implement custom rules for how to combine all the
//D: actions which happen to arrive at the same time value.  For example,
//D: it could decide that some actions are not to be executed at all, or it
//D: could create entirely new actions to be executed instead of or in
//D: addition to those which were originally scheduled.

//D: (.. Specific rules for writing a custom ActionGroup subclass will be
//D: documented at a future time, but all the apparatus to do so is present
//D: today.  A concurrent action group is currently used to maintain the
//D: proper order of execution among subswarms of an owner swarm.)

@protocol SingletonGroups
//S: Indicates that an action group should be created for every time
//S: value which is present.

//D: The SingletonGroups option indicates that an action group should be
//D: created for every time value which is present, even when only a single
//D: action is present at the time value.

//D: Ordinarily, a concurrent action group is created to process actions at
//D: the same timestep only if more than one action is scheduled at that
//D: timestep.  The overhead of these action groups is relatively low,
//D: because it just creates a single new object to which actions are
//D: directly linked, but it is still faster to avoid creating them if only
//D: one action is present at a timestep.  If a custom subclass is being
//D: provided however, it may need to examine the actions at a timestep
//D: even if there is only one.

@protocol Schedule <Map, CompoundAction, ActionCreating, RelativeTime, RepeatInterval, ConcurrentGroupType, SingletonGroups, CREATABLE>
//S: A collection of actions ordered by time values.

//D: A schedule is compound action whose basic representation is a sorted
//D: Map of actions that have been created within it.  The key value
//D: associated with each of these actions is an unsigned integer value for
//D: which the typedef timeval_t is supplied.

//D: A schedule inherits its underlying representation from the Map type of
//D: the collections library.  All the members of the ordered set must
//D: consist only of actions that are created by one of the createAction
//D: messages defined on Schedule itself.  Once the actions are created,
//D: they may be accessed or traversed using standard messages of the Map
//D: type.  The key values of this collection, however, must be cast to and
//D: from the id type defined for key values by the Map type. 

//D: The messages to create actions within a schedule are essentially the
//D: same as those for ActionGroup, except for the presence of an initial
//D: at: argument indicating the time at which an action is to be
//D: performed.  Except for the time associated with each action, meaning
//D: of the createAction messages is the same as for ActionGroup.

//D: When multiple actions are all scheduled at the same time, they are all
//D: inserted into a concurrent action group created for that time value.
//D: The ConcurrentGroupType option may be used to override the default
//D: action group for these concurrent actions by a custom user-defined
//D: subclass.  (.. Details of doing this are not yet documented, but there
//D: are examples.)
