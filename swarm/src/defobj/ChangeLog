	* defobj.h: Reenable LibraryUsage, DefaultAssumed, and ObsoleteFeature.
	Put back ObsoleteMessage (gepr argues they are important for a minor
	release).

	* defobj.h: Add APIChange to the standard error types.
	Delete ObsoleteMessage, since it appears to be redundant 
	with ObsoleteFeature.  Disable LibraryUsage, DefaultAssumed, 
	and ObsoleteFeature because they aren't used.

	* Program.m (initModules): Move initModule of Collections below
	initialization of standard zones so that it can use the zones.
