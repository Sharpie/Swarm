//S: Standard objects for GNU Objective C extensions

//D: The defobj library supports the style of object-oriented programming
//D: that is used throughout Swarm.  It defines a specific style for using
//D: the Objective C language that includes its own standard conventions for
//D: creating objects and for storage allocation, error handling, and debugging
//D: support.

@protocol DefinedObject
//S: Object with defined type and implementation.

//D: DefinedObject is the top-level supertype for all objects that follow
//D: the object programming conventions of the defobj library.  The
//D: messages defined by this type are the only messages which should be
//D: assumed to be automatically available on objects that follow these
//D: conventions.  In particular, use of messages defined by the Object
//D: superclass of the GNU Objective C runtime should not generally be
//D: assumed because future implementations of some objects might not give
//D: continued access to them.

//D: The DefinedObject type defines a minimum of standard messages, and
//D: leaves to other types the definition of message that might or might
//D: not apply in any general way to particular objects.
USING
//M: The respondsTo: message returns true if the object implements the
//M: message identified by the selector argument.  To implement a message
//M: means only that some method will receive control if the message is
//M: sent to the object.  (The method could still raise an error.)  The
//M: respondsTo: message is implemented by direct lookup in a method
//M: dispatch table, so is just as fast as a normal message send.  It
//M: provides a quick way to test whether the type of an object includes a
//M: particular message.

@protocol Customize
//S: Create-phase customization.

//D: Some types accept create-time messages not only when creating a new
//D: instance, but to customize a new version of the type itself.  Objects
//D: created from a customized type will have all options preset that
//D: create-time messages sent to the customized type object have already
//D: set.  If many objects all need the same create-time options, it is
//D: often simpler (and can also be faster) to create a customized version
//D: of a type first, and then create further instances from that type.

//D: Customizing a type object does not modify the original type object,
//D: but instead creates a new type object that has the customizations
//D: built-in.  A create: message on the new type object creates a new
//D: instance as if the same sequence of create-time messages had been
//D: sent to the original type object using createBegin: and createEnd.
//D: A type is customized by bracketing the sequence of create-time
//D: messages not with the createBegin: and createEnd messages used to
//D: create a new instance, but with customizeBegin: and customizeEnd
//D: messages instead.

//D: Whether a customized version of a type can be created depends on the
//D: implementation of the type itself.  If a type does not support
//D: customization, a customizeBegin: message on the type raises an error.
//D: All types defined by an @protocol declaration may be relied on to
//D: support at least one cycle of customization to create a new type
//D: object.  Whether an already customized type object (returned by
//D: customizeEnd) supports a further cycle of customization (by another
//D: sequence of customizeBegin:/customizeEnd) depends on the
//D: implementation of the original starting type.  A type should not be
//D: relied on to support more than one cycle of customization unless it is
//D: specifically documented to do so.

CREATING
//E: newArrayType = [Array customizeBegin: aZone];
//E: [newArrayType setCount: 100];
//E: newArrayType = [newArrayType customizeEnd];
//E: array1 = [newArrayType create: aZone];
//E: array2 = [newArrayType create: aZone];
//E: // [array1 getCount] and [array2 getCount] are both 100

//M: Returns an interim value for receiving create-time
//M: messages much like createBegin:.

//M: The zone passed to customizeBegin: is the same zone from which storage
//M: for the new, finalized type object will be taken.  This zone need not
//M: be the same as any instance later created from that type, since a new
//M: zone argument is still passed in any subsequent create message on that
//M: type.
+ customizeBegin: aZone;

//M: Returns the new, customized version of the original type.
- customizeEnd;

//M: The customizeCopy: message creates a new copy of the interim object
//M: returned by customizeBegin: which may be used for further
//M: customizations that do not affect the customization already in
//M: progress.  It may be used to branch off a path of a customization in
//M: progress to create an alternate final customization. 

//M: customizeCopy may be used only on an interim object returned by
//M: customizeBegin: and not yet finalized by customizeEnd.  The new version
//M: of the interim object being customized may be allocated in the same
//M: or different zone as the original version, using the zone argument
//M: required by customizeCopy:

//E: newArrayType1 = [Array customizeBegin: aZone];
//E: [newArrayType1 setCount: 100];
//E: newArrayType2 = [newArrayType2 customizeCopy: aZone];
//E: [newArrayType2 setDefaultMember: UnsetMember];
//E:
//E: newArrayType1 = [newArrayType1 customizeEnd];
//E:  newArrayType2 = [newArrayType2 customizeEnd];
//E: array1 = [newArrayType1 create: aZone];  // no DefaultMember option
//E: array2 = [newArrayType create: aZone];   // DefaultMember option set
- customizeCopy: aZone;
@end

@protocol Create <DefinedObject, Customize>
//S: Create an instance of a type with optional customization.

//D: The Create supertype defines standard messages that provide a
//D: general-purpose protocol for creating new objects.  These messages may
//D: be used either to create a new instance of a type in one message, or
//D: to bracket a series of messages that customize available options for
//D: an object to be created.  The separation of create-time specifications
//D: from later behavior of an object gives substantial flexibility to
//D: adapt a generic type to particular needs.

//D: These create messages may be implemented either by a type that hides its
//D: implementing classes, or directly by a class that adopts these messages as
//D: a uniform interface for creating objects.  If implemented directly by a
//D: class, then the class object serves as the type object in all message
//D: descriptions that follow.  Otherwise, a type object might be implemented
//D: in a variety of ways that guarantee only that published messages on a
//D: type are accepted.

//D: In addition to the create messages defined by Create, an object type
//D: may support any other messages of any other names or calling
//D: conventions.  These messages define only a standard method for
//D: creating new objects that other types are free to inherit and
//D: implement in conformance with a uniform convention.  Further
//D: conventions are established elsewhere create combination messages
//D: for standard ways in which create messages
//D: that combine several steps can be combined.

//D: Any interim object returned by either createBegin: or customizeBegin:
//D: supports the getZone and drop messages that a finalized instance may
//D: also support.  These messages are defined by the Drop type, which is
//D: normally inherited by a type to declare these messages on a finalized
//D: instance.  This type is not inherited by the Create type because the
//D: messages would then apply to the finalized instance, not to the
//D: interim object.  Even though not declared, the messages are available
//D: on the interim objects nonetheless.  The drop message on an interim
//D: object may be used if it turns out that a finalized version is no
//D: longer required after creation or customization has already begun.

//D: The createBegin: and createEnd messages bracket a series of messages
//D: that specify options for an object being created.  The intermediate
//D: messages can set values defined as parameters of the type, or provide
//D: other forms of specification using available messages.  A particular
//D: object type defines the specific messages that are valid for sending
//D: during this interim creation phase.

//E: newArray = [Array createBegin: aZone];
//E: [newArray setInitialValue: aList];
//E: [newArray setDefaultMember: UnsetMember];
//E: [newArray setCount: [aList getCount] * 2 );
//E: newArray = [newArray createEnd];   // ! note reassignment of newArray
CREATING
//M: The create: message creates a new instance of a type with default
//M: options.  The zone argument specifies the source of storage for the
//M: new object.  The receiving object of this message is a previously
//M: defined type object.  The message is declared as a class message (with
//M: a + declaration tag) to indicate that the message is accepted only by
//M: the type object itself rather than an already created instance of the
//M: type (which a - declaration tag otherwise defines).

//M: The create: message returns the new object just created.  This object is
//M: an instance of some class selected to implement the type.  The class
//M: which a type selects to implement an object may be obtained by the
//M: getClass message, but is not otherwise visible to the calling program.
//M: A caller never refers to any class name when creating objects using
//M: these messages, only to type names, which are automatically published
//M: as global constants from any @protocol declaration. 
+ create: aZone;

//M: createBegin: returns an interim object intended only for receiving
//M: create-time messages.  If a type was defined by a @protocol
//M: declaration, these messages are those appearing in either the CREATING
//M: or SETTING sections.  Otherwise, the messages valid as create-time
//M: messages are defined by the type without any specific syntactic
//M: marker.
+ createBegin: aZone;

//M: The createEnd message completes the process of specifying available
//M: options for an object being created.  Typically it validates that
//M: requested options are valid and consistent with one another, and
//M: raises an error if they are not.  The standard, predefined error
//M: InvalidCombination may be raised by createEnd to indicate an
//M: invalid combination of requests, or other, more specific forms
//M: of error handling may be used.

//M: If all requests received since the initial createBegin: are valid,
//M: both individually and in combination with each other, then createEnd
//M: determines a finalized form of object that satisfies all requests
//M: received and then returns this object.  Any additional storage
//M: required for the finalized object is taken from the same zone
//M: originally passed to createBegin.  The object may have whatever
//M: implementation is selected to best satisfy a particular request.
//M: Different requests may result in entirely different implementations
//M: being returned.  The only guarantee is that a returned object supports
//M: the messages defined for further use of the finalized object.  If a
//M: type was defined by a @protocol declaration, these messages are those
//M: appearing in either the SETTING or USING sections.

//M: On return from createEnd, the id of the interim object returned by
//M: createBegin: is no longer guaranteed to be valid for further use, and
//M: should no longer be referenced.  A variable which holds this such an
//M: id can be reassigned the new id returned by createEnd, so that the
//M: same variable holds successive versions of the object being created.
- createEnd;
@end

@protocol Drop
//S: Deallocate an object allocated within a zone.

//D: The Drop supertype defines the drop message, which is a standard
//D: message for indicating that an object no longer exists and will never
//D: again be referenced.  Any future attempt to reference a dropped object
//D: is an error.  This error may or not produce predictable effects
//D: depending on the level of debug checking and other factors.

//M: Immediate effects of the drop message depends on the subtype of Zone
//M: used to provide storage for the object.  For some zone types, the drop
//M: message immediately deallocates storage for the object and makes the
//M: freed storage available for other use.  Subsequent use could include
//M: the allocation of a new object at precisely the same location,
//M: resulting in a new object id identical to a previously dropped one.

//M: The Drop type may be inherited by any type that provides drop support
//M: for its instances.  In addition to freeing the storage and
//M: invalidating the object, a drop message may release other resources
//M: acquired or held within the object.  Not every object which can be
//M: created can also be dropped, and some objects can be dropped which are
//M: not directly creatable.  Some objects may be created as a side effect
//M: of other operations and still be droppable, and some objects may be
//M: created with links to other objects and not droppable on their own.  A
//M: type independently inherits Create or Drop types, or both, to indicate
//M: its support of these standard interfaces to define the endpoints of an
//M: object lifecycle.
USING
- (void)drop;
@end

@protocol Zone <Create, Drop, CREATABLE>
//S: Modular unit of storage allocation.

//D: A zone is a source of storage for objects or other allocated data.
//D: Whenever a new object is created, a zone must be identified from which
//D: the storage for its instance variables, or other internal data, is
//D: obtained.  A program may establish multiple zones to ensure that
//D: objects with similar lifetime or storage needs are allocated together,
//D: and in general to optimize allocation and reuse of storage.

//D: Zones also maintain a collection of all objects allocated within the
//D: zone.  This collection, referred to as the "population" of a zone, is
//D: a set of all objects which have been created but not yet dropped
//D: within the zone.  Collections maintained automatically by zones can
//D: eliminate a need for other, separately maintained collections in
//D: applications that need to keep track of entire populations of objects.
//D: Collections of allocated objects can provide support for object query,
//D: external object storage, and automatic storage reclamation.

//D: A zone may be used to obtain storage not only for objects, but also
//D: for raw storage blocks like those provided by the C malloc function.
//D: All objects and storage blocks allocated in a zone remain local to
//D: that zone.  This means that allocation of storage in other zones does
//D: not affect the efficiency of storage allocation within a particular
//D: zone.  For most zone types, individual allocations may still be freed
//D: within a zone, and total storage of a zone may grow and shrink
//D: according to aggregate needs.  In addition to freeing individual
//D: allocations, an entire zone may also dropped.  Dropping a zone
//D: automatically frees all allocations made within it, including final
//D: drop processing on any allocated objects that need it.  Release of an
//D: entire zone can be much faster than individual release of each object
//D: within it.

//D: The Zone type is a fully implemented type that provides default
//D: storage management support for objects and other allocated storage.
//D: It is also a supertype for other zones that implement alternative
//D: policies for use in specialized situations.

//D: A zone is created using standard create messages just like other
//D: objects.  This means that a zone must identify another zone from which
//D: it obtains its storage.  Storage is typically obtained from this other
//D: zone in large units called pages, which are then managed by the local
//D: zone to support internal allocations.  The getZone message of the
//D: DefinedObject type returns the zone which provides these
//D: base pages.

//D: Since a new zone always requires that an existing zone be identified,
//D: no new zones could be created unless there were some zones that
//D: already existed.  Two such zones are predefined as part of the
//D: defobj library: globalZone and scratchZone.

CREATING
//M: PageSize specifies the size of pages within which a zone manages its
//M: internal allocation.  Its default is typically a natural page size
//M: (perhaps 4K) for the local machine architecture.  The default should
//M: be overridden only when tuning storage allocation for very specific
//M: situations.  Allocations within a zone are not limited to the page
//M: size, since any requests that exceed the page size are simply passed
//M: up to the owner zone within which the zone was allocated.

@protocol Copy
//S: Copy all state defined as part of object.

//D: An object type that supplies the copy operation defines what it

//D: by it.  (There is no fixed notion of "shallow" vs. "deep" copy found

@protocol GetOwner
//S: Get object on which existence of object depends.

//D: Ownership hierarchies arrange themselves in a strict, single-rooted

//D: another object defined as its owner, then copying or dropping the
//D: owner object should copy or drop the member object as well.  Owner and
//D: member are neutral terms for a generic relationship sometimes called
//D: parent vs.  child, but it is up to a particular object type to define
//D: specifically what it means by a getOwner relationship.

//M: The getOwner message returns another object which is considered as the
//M: owner of an initial object.  What is considered as an owner depends on
//M: its specific object type, but might be a larger object of which the
//M: local object is a part, or an object that has exclusive control over

@protocol SetInitialValue
//S: Create using initial value from an existing object.

//D: The SetInitialValue type defines a variety of messages relating to an
//D: initial or unmodifiable value established as part of an object.  This
//D: message is typically provided when creation of a new object might be
//D: more easily accomplished by copying the value of an existing object
//D: rather than establishing a new value from scratch.  As with the copy
//D: message, precisely what is considered the value of an existing object
//D: to copy is defined only by the particular object type that supplies
//D: these messages.

//D: If an object has a value which can be established at create time, it
//D: is often useful (and can also enable significant optimization) to
//D: declare that no further modification will occur to this value during
//D: further use of the object.  A restriction against modifying a value is
//D: referred to as a "read-only" restriction.  This type supplies messages
//D: to declare a read-only restriction along with any initial value.  For
//D: some object types, a read-only restriction can also be added or
//D: removed after an object has already been created.

CREATING
//M: The setInitialValue: message requires another object as its argument,
//M: from which the value of a newly created object is to be taken.  Unlike
//M: a copy message, the object used as the source of the new value need
//M: not have the identical type as the new object to be created.  A

//M: which it can accept, along with any special conversion or
//M: interpretation it might apply to such a value.

@protocol Symbol <Create, GetName, CREATABLE>
//S: Object defined as a distinct global id constant.

//D: A Symbol is an object created with a fixed name.  It has no behavior
//D: except to get the name with which it was created.  A Symbol is
//D: typically used to define unique id values which are assigned to global
//D: constant names.  These names, capitalized according to the recommended
//D: convention for global object constants, are used by some libraries as
//D: flags or enumerated value codes in arguments or return values of
//D: messages.

//D: Ordinarily, a symbol is created with its character string name
//D: matching the global id constant to which it is assigned.  These global
//D: program constants can then provide a minimal level of self
//D: documentation as objects.  Subtypes of Symbol can extend the base of a
//D: named, global id constant to establish further components of a global,
//D: constant definition.
