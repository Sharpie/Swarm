This directory contains the code for version 0.7 of
the random number library for Swarm, supplied with
Swarm version 1.0.3.

If Swarm has been installed properly, you need only
say 'make' to recompile all the objects and renew
the library .a file. You can then do 'make clean'
to get rid of all the .o files, which are not
needed to run Swarm.

Look in the /docs subdirectory for documentation of
the objects defined in this library.

The following subdirectories contain test programs:

/testR0: program to verify that getState/setState works
         and that the objects are operating correctly
/testR4: program to conduct timing tests
/testR6: program to generate binary files for statistical tests
         (see /ENT and /Diehard under /testR6)
/testR7: program to print certain data for every object
/testR8: program to get every object to 'describe' itself

/tests.v06: programs from the previous release, which
            have not been updated to work with this one.
