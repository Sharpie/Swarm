Modified by:     Sven Thommesen
Date:            1997-01-15 (v. 0.6)
Changes:	 Cast the "old style" objective-C objects to Swarm objects,
		 using create phase protocols.

Modified by:	 Sven Thommesen
Date:		 1997-09-01 (v. 0.7)
Changes:	 Fixed bug: carry was not being set properly between calls.
			--> alters output compared to v. 0.6.
		 Changed the inline LCG to a PMMLCG (for seed generation).
			--> alters output compared to v. 0.6.
		 Changed the initial 'runup' length from 5*r to r (max. needed.)
			--> alters output compared to v. 0.6.
		 Standardized the informational comments.
		 Sub-classed SWB1,SWB2,SWB3.
		 Added floating point output (float, double, long double).
		 Revised the 'magic number' numbering scheme.

Modified by:	Sven Thommesen
Date:		1998-10-08 (v. 0.8)
Changes:	Code cleanup related to signed/unsigned comparisons.
		Code rearranged for create-phase compatibility.
		Added -drop method.
		Added -reset method.
		Fixed memset bug in SWBi: -initState

--------------- | Generator Documentation:
		| ------------------------

Generator name:	| SWB

Description:	| Subtract-with-Borrow Congruential Generator

Reference:	| George Marsaglia and Arif Zaman, 
		| "A New Class of Random Number Generators",
		| Annals of Applied Probability vol 1 no 3 (1991), 462-480.
		| SWB is an improvement on the Lagged Fibonacci generators.

		| state vector = f(seed)
Algorithm:	| state_n = (state_(n-s) - state_(n-r) - carry) mod 2^32; r > s
		| output = state_n

		| These generators use a basic algorithm of the form
		| X_n = f(X_(n-r),X_(n-s)) mod m; r>s
		| The function f is typically xor, addition, subtraction,
		| multiplication or subtraction with carry. It uses 
		| simpler math than a basic LCG, but keeps a larger state.

Note:		| This generator relies on controlled overflow at 32 bits.
		| This requires that unsigned be a 32bit value that follows
		| ANSI C rules.

Implementation:	| The state vector contains the generator's r most recent
		| outputs (X_n .. X_(n-r)). This vector is initialized from
		| an LCG generator using one 32-bit seed value. After 
		| initialization we throw away r*5 numbers to 'prime' the
		| generator (i.e. make sure we have entered a closed cycle.)

Parameters:	| unsigned int r		// long lag
		| unsigned int s		// short lag

State:		| unsigned int state[r]		// state vector
		| int carry			// carry bit

Output types:	| unsigned int (we return the current state).
		| float in [0.0,1.0) using 1 iteration of the generator.
		| double in [0.0,1.0) using 1 or 2 iterations of the generator.
		| long double in [0.0,1.0) using 2 iterations of the generator.
		| (See the implementation file for more details.)

Output range:	| Any number in the range [0,2^32-1] may be returned
		| (i.e. [0,4294967295].)

Valid seeds:	| Using create:setStateFromSeed:  [1,2^32-1]
		| Using create:setStateFromSeeds: r seeds in [1,2^32-2]
		| and one seed in [0,1] (the carry)

Cycles:		| With properly chosen parameters, these generators
		| have a number of long cycles, up to 10^354 in length.
		| UNFORTUNATELY there is no way to pick different 
		| cycles, nor any easy way to 'jump ahead' in the
		| chosen cycle (other than calling -getUnsignedSample
		| a number of times). 

Output Quality:	| Much better than other Lagged Fibonacci generators, such as
		| ACG and SCG.

Reference for	| Marsaglia and Zaman, op.cit.
output quality:	| 

SWBgen		| On a 486/66, the following approximate measures were obtained:
speed:		|   -getUnsignedSample:                       3.285 uS
		|   -getFloatSample, getDoubleSample:         5.057 uS
		|   -getFatDoubleSample, getLongDoubleSample: 9.209 uS

Relative speed:	| Speed 1.126 (time 0.888) relative to MT19937 getUnsignedSample
