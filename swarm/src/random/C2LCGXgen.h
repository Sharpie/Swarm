--------------- | Generator Documentation:

Generator name:	| C2LCGX

Description:	| Combined random generator using 2 (PMM)LGC generators

Reference:	| Pierre L'Ecuyer and Serge Cote,
		| "Implementing a Random Number Package with Splitting 
		| Facilities." ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software 
		| vol. 17 no. 1, March 1991, pp. 98-111.
		| Their name for the generator: 'split.c'.
		| See also <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer>.

Comments:	| This portable generator is based on a backbone generator
		| which is a combination of 2 (PMM)LCG generators. It has a
		| period length of almost 2^61 (2.3e18).

		| The backbone generator's period can be split up into a
		| number of 'virtual generators' (A), each of which can be set
		| to access a number of 'segments' (V) of length W, subject to
		| the constraint that A * V * W <= 2^60.

		| This is possible because the backbone generator has 
		| 'jump-ahead facilities' -- i.e. a quick method of calculating
		| the state of the generator at a given point in its cycle
		| without having to actually draw a large number of variates.

Algorithm	| state(j) = seed(j)
for each	| newstate(j) = (a(j) * oldstate(j)) mod m(j)
generator:	| output(j) = state(j)

Algorithm	| output = (state(1) - state(2)) mod m(0)
for combination:| 

Comments:	| For a discussion of PMMLCG generators, see the source file
		| PMMLCGgen.h.

Configuration	| unsigned int numGenerators;		// # virtual generators
parameters:	| unsigned int numSegments;		// log2(#segments/vGen)
		| unsigned int segmentLength;		// log2(segment length)

State:		| unsigned int state [numGenerators] [2];
		| (each virtual generator has a 4-integer state vector)

Output types	| unsigned int in [0,unsignedMax].
(for each	| float in [0.0,1.0) using 1 iteration of the generator.
virtual		| double in [0.0,1.0) using 1 or 2 iterations of the generator.
generator):	| long double in [0.0,1.0) using 2 iterations of the generator.

Output range:	| The combined generator yields output in the range [0,m0-1]
		| (i.e. [0,2147483562].)

Limits on	| Number of generators A <= 2^25  (33,554,432)
parameters:	| (You'll likely run out of memory before then ...)
		| Number of segments / generator <= 2^60 (i.e. v <= 60)
		| Length of each segment <= 2^60 (i.e. w <= 60)

Defaults:	| A=32, v=20, w=30

Valid seeds:	| Using create:setStateFromSeed: in [1, 2^32-1]
		| Using create:setStateFromSeeds:
		| The generator must be seeded with 2 starting seeds:
		| 	Seed[0]: [1, 2147483562] = [1,m1-1]
		| 	Seed[1]: [1, 2147483398] = [1,m2-1]

Cycles:		| With properly chosen parameters, the component generators
		| have a single full cycle of length (m-2).
		| The combined generator has a cycle length of
		| (m1-1)*(m2-1)/2 = 2147483562*2147483398/2 ~= 2^61.

Output Quality:	| All bits should be safe.
		| The combined generator has much better statistical
		| properties than either of its component PMMLCG's.

Reference for	| L'Ecuyer and Cote, op. cit.
output quality:	| 

Implementation  | The code for -getUnsignedMax uses a trick devised by
comment:        | Schrage to avoid 32-bit overflow when calculating the
		| next state (i.e. using q=m/a and r=m%a as auxiliary
		| values). Using 64-bit math (long long integers) is more
		| straightforward. Unfortunately, on x86 at least, there is 
		| a significant speed penalty for doing so.
		| The output, however, would be identical. YMMV.

C2LCGXgen	| On a 486/66, the following approximate measures were obtained:
speed:		|   -getUnsignedSample:                        7.029 uS
		|   -getFloatSample, getDoubleSample:          9.049 uS
		|   -getFatDoubleSample, getLongDoubleSample: 16.725 uS

Relative speed:	| Speed 0.526 (time 1.900) relative to MT19937 getUnsignedSample
