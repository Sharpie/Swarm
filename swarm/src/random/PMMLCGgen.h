--------------- | Generator Documentation:
		| ------------------------

Generator name:	| PMMLCG

Description:	| Prime Modulus Multiplicative Linear Congruential Generator

Reference:	| Stephen K. Park and Keith W. Miller 
		| (CACM 31:10, October 1988, 1192-1201),
		| "Random Number Generators: Good Ones Are Hard To Find."
		| The authors refer to this generator as a "minimally
		| acceptable" or "minimally sufficient" generator.

		| state = seed
Algorithm:	| newstate = (a * oldstate) mod m
		| output = state-1

Comments:	| The modulus m must be a prime for this class of generator
		| (as opposed to the more common power of two modulus).
		| For these generators we use m=2^31-1 (2,147,483,647).
		| The choice of a good multiplier a is crucial.

Parameters:	| unsigned int m	// modulus
		| unsigned int a	// multiplier

State:		| unsigned int state	// a "state vector" of length 1

Output types:	| unsigned int (we return the current state-1).
		| float in [0.0,1.0) using 1 iteration of the generator.
		| double in [0.0,1.0) using 1 or 2 iterations of the generator.
		| long double in [0.0,1.0) using 2 iterations of the generator.
		| (See the implementation file for more details.)

Output range:	| The basic algorithm yields output in the range [1,m-1].
		| We subtract 1 to return output in the range [0,m-2]
		| (i.e. [0,2147483645].)

Valid seeds:	| create:setStateFromSeed:  [1, 2^32-1]
		| create:setStateFromSeeds: [1, m-1]

Cycles:		| With properly chosen parameters, these generators
		| have a single full cycle of length (m-1).
		| (State=0 is an absorbing state which will not normally
		| occur; we avoid setting the starting state to 0.)

Output Quality:	| All bits should be safe.
		| (I.e. low order bits should not have small cycles.)
		| With m prime, this generator is better than standard LCG.

Reference for	| Park and Miller, op. cit.
output quality:	| 

Implementation  | The code for -getUnsignedMax uses a trick devised by
comment:        | Schrage to avoid 32-bit overflow when calculating the
		| next state (i.e. using q=m/a and r=m%a as auxiliary
		| values). Using 64-bit math (long long integers) is more
		| straightforward. Unfortunagely, on x86 at least, there
		| is a 35% speed penalty for doing so. The output, however,
		| is identical. YMMV.

PMMLCGgen	| On a 486/66, the following approximate measures were obtained:
speed:		|   -getUnsignedSample:                        4.715 uS
		|   -getFloatSample, getDoubleSample:          6.500 uS
		|   -getFatDoubleSample, getLongDoubleSample: 12.152 uS

Relative speed:	| Speed 0.792 (time 1.263) relative to MT19937 getUnsignedSample
