//S: Module for random number generation

//D: This module consists of a set of random number generation classes
//D: and a set of distribution classes for transforming random number
//D: sequences into various simulated probability distributions.

#import <objectbase.h>		// for protocol SwarmObject


@protocol InternalState
//S: Archiving routines for internal generator and distribution state.

//D: Methods to save the internal state of an object (generator, distribution)
//D: to a memory buffer allocated by the calling program, and to set the state
//D: of an object from previously saved state data, provided in a memory
//D: buffer.

//D: NOTE: the putStateInto/setStateFrom methods are NOT portable across 
//D: architectures, since they store integers and doubles using different
//D: byte orders. A portable storage method may be provided in the next
//D: release.

USING
//M: Specifies the minimum buffer size needed.
- (unsigned)getStateSize;		// size of buffer needed
- (void)putStateInto: (void *)buffer;	// save state data for later use
- (void)setStateFrom: (void *)buffer;	// set state from saved data
- (void)describe: outStream;	        // prints ascii data to stream
- (const char *)getName;		// returns name of object
- (unsigned)getMagic;			// object's 'magic number'
