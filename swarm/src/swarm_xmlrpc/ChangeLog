	* SwarmXMLRPCFProxy.m ([SwarmXMLRPCFProxy -getName]): Copy the
	internal string before returning.  (In cases like proxied foreign
	objects, the underlying string returned by getName may move
	around, e.g. from garbage collection.  Common usage is to copy and
	have the user take responsibility for the memory (typically in the
	scratch zone).
