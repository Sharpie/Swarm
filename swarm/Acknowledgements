			    The Swarm Team

   The Swarm project is headed up by Chris Langton, director of
Artificial Life at the Santa Fe Institute. Swarm is being designed and
programmed by Chris Langton (SFI), Roger Burkhart (John Deere), and
Glen Ropella (SFI).  Much of the development of Swarm was done by
Nelson Minar, who is now at the MIT Media Lab, and Manor Askenazi.
The new random library was written by Sven Thommesen and graciously
contributed.  Eric Carr and JJ Merelo have been patient Swarm users
and developers. Howard Gutowitz and David Hiebeler have participated
in the design process.  (David is also the implementor of the original
Swarm prototype.)  And, many thanks to Simon Frasier, Swarm graphic
designer extraordinaire.  Finally, many thanks go out to the Swarm
user community, particularly those who have stuck with us from the
beginning.


                                  Sincerely,
                                  The Hive at SFI
