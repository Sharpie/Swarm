**** Avoid use of a `char' return type, another libffi bug.

*** space
**** Check argument conformance against _Discrete2d, not Discrete2d.
**** Remove redundant error checking in Int2dFiler's fileTo: method.

** Interface bug fixes
*** collections
**** Removed unimplemented Queue and Stack from collections interface.
**** Removed mention of unimplemention DupOption feature from collections
     interface.
**** Removed KeyedCollection's getCountAtKey:, constainsKey:, and
     {get,set}IndexFromMember:.
**** Removed KeyCollectionIndex's setMember:.

*** gui
**** Declare -setWidth:.

** Namespace hygiene
*** collections
**** String.[hm] is now StringObject.[hm] to avoid conflicts with <string.h>
     on case insensitive filesystems.
*** Use misc.h for stdlib.h, stdio.h, string.h, and unistd.h features
    (or replacements) throughout.

** Other changes
*** Build environment
**** Makefile.appl and Makefile.lib are now installed in $SWARMHOME/etc/swarm.
     This is to facilitate consistent naming in system-wide installs (/usr)
     as well with arbitrary prefix paths.
*** analysis
**** ActiveGraph (simtoolsgui) and ActiveOutFile (simtools) are now in the
     analysis library.  These have been moved to facilitate the elimination
     of simtoolsgui, which will be replaced by a standalone Swarm Monitor
     application.

*** defobj
**** @deftype has been replaced with @protocol throughout.  @deftype had
no special semantics and tended to confuse readers of the Swarm source code.

*** gui
**** Graph
***** The arguments to setScaleModeX:Y: are now boolean, not integers.
**** VarProbeEntry
***** setVarProbe: replaces setProbeType:.  This change was needed to
facilitate drag and drop in the new MultiVarProbeWidget.
**** Widget
***** setPositionX:Y: has been renamed to setX:Y:.
**** WindowGeometryRecord -- changes to facilitate independent archiving
of size and position.
***** getX, getY, getSizeFlag, and getPositionFlag replace
      getWindowGeometryRecord.
***** setX:Y:, and setWidth:Height: replace setWindowGeometryRecord:.

*** objectbase
**** isInteractive has been renamed to getInteractiveFlag.

*** simtoolsgui
**** There is no longer a Step button on the control panel.  It did not
     have meaningful semantics given the current GUI infrastructure.

* Release Notes for Swarm 1.2

**  A system for customizable command line argument parsing.

*** simtools can now be initialized with initSwarmArguments (as well as with 
    initSwarm).  The third argument must be a subclass of
    objectbase/Arguments, and you can add variables and methods as you like. 
    If you initialize Swarm with initSwarm, you only get the default options.
*** objectbase/Arguments now provides default implementations of two
    new methods: `addOptions:' and `parseKey:arg:'
    - `addOptions:' takes an option specification that includes the
      a name, key and documentation that appears on the help screen.
    - `parseKey:arg:' is called for each option that occurs. The user must 
      supply the code that implements what is to be done with each option.

**  User interface/graphics

*** More graphical widgets for drawing on Raster (lines, ellipses, rectangles).
    Add [ -ellipseX0:Y0:X1:Y1:Width:Color], [-lineX0:Y0:X1:Y1:Width:Color:],
    and [ -rectangleX0:Y0:X1:Y1:Width:Color:] methods.
*** New protocols ButtonPanel, Form, CheckButton, OvalNodeItem, 
    RectangleNodeItem, CanvasItem, TextItem, Circle, Rectangle,and Line. 
*** Portable pixmaps using PNG format.  XPixmap has been replaced by a 
    protocol called Pixmap.

**  Documentation overhaul

*** Introduction of Literate programming (interface reference documentation 
    is in the Swarm source code).  Markup system vastly improved:
    DocBook SGML instead of HTML.  DocBook is a modern documentation system 
    with rich markup oriented toward commercial software.
*** Documentation system can output TeX, RTF, PostScript and HTML.
*** Documentation system is *highly* extensible. Added support for Objective C.
    Support for several types of indices. Numerous formatting changes

**  Installation

*** An autoconfiguration system for Swarm (and swarmdocs).
*** Package now conforms with standard GNU conventions to make installation
    simpler.
*** InstallShield system for Windows-based installation.

**  All Swarm functionality is now exported through a single, well-defined
    interface: Objective C protocols.

  ---------------------------

* Release Notes for Swarm 1.1

**  Command line arguments are now parsed into a single object by the
    Arguments class in objectbase, an interface to GNU argp.
    The help screen is also now generated using GNU argp.

**  Message probes are now done using either the libffi or ffcall libraries
    rather than by tclobjc.

**  There is now a GUI protocol defined by gui.h.  This should replace
    use of tkobjc.h in all applications. 

**  A number of new classes in tkobjc, currently used for internal purposes. 
    These classes eliminate use of globalTkInterp elsewhere in Swarm,
    and facilitate the forthcoming AWT GUI.  Several existing classes
    were renamed.

**  Support for Tcl/Tk 8.0 and BLT8.0-unoff in tkobjc.
 
**  Support for Win32/GDI in tkobjc.

**  Heuristics to determine SWARMHOME, TCL_LIBRARY, TK_LIBRARY, 
    and BLT_LIBRARY, when they aren't correct or are unspecified.

**  simtools is now split into two libraries:  simtools, the non-GUI pieces
    and simtoolsgui, the library that now contains classes like ControlPanel,
    and other graphical simulation features.

  ---------------------------

* Release Notes for Swarm 1.0.5

**  Variant method names for passthru to setWindowGeometryRecordName have been
    eliminated.  In these cases, the resulting key is computed from the
    components involved.  Thanks to Ken Cline for the idea.  For these
    `GUIComposite' objects, the macro SET_COMPONENT_WINDOW_GEOMETRY_RECORD_NAME
    is used for naming the subcomponents; it uses the subcomponent widget
    instance variable argument as the name.

**  The macro SET_WINDOW_GEOMETRY_RECORD_NAME provides a convenience
    interface to setWindowGeometryRecordName:.  This macro takes a widget
    instance variable as an argument and derives the archiving key from that.

**  The methods create[Complete]ProbeDisplayFor:setWindowGeometryRecordName:
    have been removed in favor of the macros CREATE_ARCHIVED_PROBE_DISPLAY 
    and CREATE_ARCHIVED_COMPLETE_PROBE_DISPLAY.  These macros derive the
    archiving key from the argument variable.
 
**  Save and Quit no longer result in a timestep.  Thanks to Rick Riolo
    for reporting this.

**  Using the method enableDestroyNotification: notificationMethod:
    with a target object (e.g. the parent) and handler method, it is possible
    for your application to disable top level user interface features after
    user kills from the window manager.  See heatbugs for an example of this.

**  ProbeDisplays were not equipped with #5, so kills from the window
    manager could result Tk becoming confused (a fairly common operation 
    with popular window managers like fvwm95).  Thanks to Pietro Terna
    for his assistance in debugging this.
 
**  Histo and Canvas are now subclassed from ArchivedGeometryWidget; their
    geometry can now be saved.

**  Active graph items in a BLTGraph were not being properly hilighted
    with BLT 2.3.  Thanks to Pietro Terna for reporting this.

**  Fixed problem with ClassDisplayWidget misdirecting armSuperButton.

**  The path for BLT support files is checked before Swarm is started.

* Release Notes for Swarm 1.0.4

**  Added ActionCache and ActionHolder and changed control scheme for
    top level Swarm in anticipation of the Java GUI residing in a separate
    thread.

**  Added protocol interface for simtools.

**  Added AppendFile class in simtools, for allowing users to open
    files in append mode (OutFile always opens files in overwrite mode)

**  Added a new method to QSort class in simtools [QSort +reverseOrderOf:]
    Reverses the current order of a collection. This can be used in
    conjunction with the regular sort methods to obtained a reversed 
    sorted list.

**  Added local [NodeItem -drop] method to tkobjc, so that graph nodes 
    (both items and text) are removed from a canvas properly, when the
    node is dropped in the usual way.

**  Added [ProbeLibrary {get,set}DisplayPrecision:] for globally setting
    the number of significant figures displayed on a widget for all 
    probes for floats and doubles checked out of the global ProbeLibrary
    instance. Also added [ProbeLibrary {get,set}SavedPrecision:] for 
    globally setting the number of significant figures for floats and
    doubles, saved through ObjectSaver. Currently, this is only 
    implemented for VarProbes, not for MessageProbes, as yet. If neither
    of these are set in an application, it will default to the a
    precision of six (6) figures, in both cases, which reflects the 
    current default precision for floats and doubles.

**  Added [Probe setFormatFloat:] method to Probes, to allow the user
    to specify a given format string (sprintf-style) for formatting of
    floating-point (and double floating-point) numbers. As indicated
    above, this is currently only implemented for VarProbes, not 
    MessageProbes, as yet. This method will override any globally
    specified defaults, as set by the ProbeLibrary feature.

**  Added a generic hook to the probe mechanism such that an object
    (designed by the application to accept the right message) will be
    sent a message whenever a probe is used.

**  Renamed the "swarmobject" library to "objectbase" to avoid
    filename conflicts in brain-dead operating systems.

**  The random library has been upgraded to version 0.75.
    See src/random/docs/WHATS.CHANGED.in.0.75 for details.

**  Added the class Archiver to do coordinate archiving of object state 
    to the file ~/.swarmArchiver.

**  Added the class ArchivedGeometryWidget from which many widgets now inherit.
    Of particular interest is the method setWindowGeometryRecordName
    which can be used to set a name that the Archiver will use to record 
    geometry information to file.

**  Added the method setControlPanelGeometryRecordName to GUISwarm.
    This method allows a control panel to be named, and thus have its
    geometry saved by the Archiver.

**  Added the argument -appMode to give the Archiver extra information
    about `mode of use'.  For example, it may be desirable to have
    a panels positioned in one way for a demo, and a another way for
    everyday research use.

**  Added a Save button to the control panel.  This button tells the
    Archiver to record the state of suitably modified objects.  See Heatbugs
    for an example of how to do this.  With unmodifed applications,
    this button will be a NOP.

**  Added the class InputStream.  InputStream is currently equipped to load
    simple Lisp-like expressions.

**  All non-tkobjc library use of globalTkInterp has been eliminated.
    This is part of an ongoing effort to make Swarm libraries
    as independent from GUI features as possible.  Code that
    talks to globalTkInterp is now found in tkobjc/control.[hm].
    Libraries now use functions prefixed with "tkobjc_".

**  SimpleProbeDisplay and CompleteProbeDisplay now inherit from a
    common abstract class, CommonProbeDisplay.  These classes are 
    now less convoluted.

**  BLT 2.3 is now supported (Tcl/Tk 8.0 is supported by Swarm and tclobjc,
    but BLT 2.3 doesn't yet support Tcl/Tk 8.0).

**  Strings and other constant parameters in Swarm are now coded with `const'.

**  Dropping a probe panel during a running simulation no longer
    results in a crash.

**  Dynamic schedule changes outside of the current Swarm (but within
    the same toplevel hierarchy) now actually work.

**  Subclassing of VarProbe and MessageProbe is now possible.

**  ObjectLoader has a setTemplateProbeMap and getLine method.

  ---------------------------

* Release Notes for Swarm 1.0.3

**  In the activity library, a bug in the internal scheduling of a swarm
    has been fixed, so that internally created concurrent actions are
    correctly freed when they have completed.  (These actions are
    automaticallly created whenever multiple schedules running happen
    to be scheduled at the same time within a swarm.)

**  Logic for the "remove" method in schedules has been revised to work
    correctly for two-level schedules, in which a concurrent schedule at
    the second level is created externally to hold times at a finer
    granularity than the times in a containing schedule.

**  The AutoDrop action is automatically passed through from a containing
    schedule to any concurrent group it contains.  Previously, the AutoDrop
    option had to be specified explicitly on a special concurrent group
    type initialized with the schedule.  Now the AutoDrop option for any
    concurrent groups is automatically set to the same as the schedule in
    which it is contained.  (Any existing setting of the option on the
    concurrent group type is ignored.)

**  A bug that returned an incorrect value from "getAutoDrop" on an
    ActionGroup or Schedule has been fixed.

**  The defobj, collections, and activity libraries have been fixed to
    avoid sending messages to a nil receiver during library initialization.
    Other swarm libraries remain free of this.  Good practice in debugging
    is to always run with a gdb breakpoint, or with a patched version of the
    gcc Objective C library (libobjc.a), to intercept any call to a nil
    message receiver.  (See swarm debugging hints in the Swarm documentation
    for more information.)

**  Debugging print messages have been restructured internally.  The
    functions xprint, xprintid, xfprint, and xfprintid remain callable
    from the debugger.  The internal methods that these functions call have
    been changed to be consistent in the way in which they direct output.

**  Additional "describe" methods have been coded for schedule-related
    objects in the activity library.  These methods (callable from gdb
    via "xprint") provide an initial, rudimentary form of schedule
    "browse" capability.  To use the capability, simply call the function
    xfprint from the gdb command line: "call xfprint(aSchedule)" where the
    argument can be any valid schedule or action group.

**  A macro named PTRFMT is defined in defobj.h to print only the number
    of significant hexadecimal digits in a pointer-sized word.  This macro is
    used by debugging print messages to avoid printing double the number of
    required digits on a machine with 32-bit words.  (The precision had been
    expanded in swarm-1.0.2 to run on 64-bit pointer architectures.)

**  Internal changes have been to some methods to use appropriate integer
    argument types.

**  Added Nelson Minar's Discrete2d changes that save and load a Discrete2d
    space in PGM format.

**  Incorporated Jason Jay's fix to ObjectLoader in reading single
    quoted strings.

**  Added Manor Askenazi's bug fix and enhancements to QSort. (Ref.
    http://www.santafe.edu/projects/swarm/archive/list-archive.9708/0149.html)

**  This release includes Random v0.7, written by Sven Thommesen.  This 
    version adds several new bit generators and distributions and
    rearranges the library.  (Ref.
    $SWARMHOME/src/random/docs/WHATS.CHANGED.in.0.7 and WHATS.NEW.in.0.7)

**  Another command line option has been added so that a user can run
    in one of two modes with respect to the random number generation.
    By default, two separate runs of a model will use the same seed for
    the default random number generators.  This facilitates debugging
    applications without forcing the user to create their own generator.
    By invoking the applications with the "-varySeed" command line option,
    the seed for any given run will be different from another run for
    the default generators.

**  Another command line option has been added to initSwarm to provide
    quick&dirty help on the available command line options.  If a user
    invokes an application with the "-help" command line flag, this 
    help text will appear.

  ---------------------------

* Release Notes for Swarm 1.0.2

**  Kernel was made compatible with DEC Unix on the Alpha.
**  Raster, BLTGraph, and EZGraph "drop" now include Tk frame
    destruction.
**  "getHeight" and "getWidth" methods were added to ZoomRaster.
**  Default ProbeMap creation was fixed by returning the correct
    BOOL type within "isProbeMapDefinedFor:".
**  Float and double format outputs in OutFile were changed to "%15.7e"
    "%24.16e", respectively.

  ---------------------------

* Release Notes for Swarm 1.0.1

**  Added different colored lines in EZGraph
**  EZBin Tcl/Tk fixed
**  ProbeDisplay notification
**  Tk raster refresh fix
**  Added custom probemap create method
**  Change in default probemap behavior
**  Removed printfs from random

  ---------------------------

* Release Notes for Swarm  1.0.0

This release is primarily a cleanup of the previous beta releases to
provide a stable version as the first production release of Swarm.
Additional demo applications and documentation have also been added.

The new release has a few areas of possible incompatibility with
previous releases.  Four paragraphs in the release notes below (marked
as IMPORTANT NOTE!) summarize the possible incompatibilities.  Only
one of the incompatible changes (a new random library) is likely to
require major changes to code, another (a new swarmobject header file)
may require changes to imported files, and the other two are unlikely
to be encountered.

Following is a summary of new features in the Swarm 1.0.0 release:

**  Dropping a zone (using the standard drop message) now drops all the
    objects that have been created within the zone.  By creating all
    its objects in a single zone, an experiment now has an easy and
    reliable way to release all the storage it has allocated.  Multiple
    runs of experiments (setting parameters differently each time) have
    been demonstrated successfully in both batch or GUI mode.

**  The random library has been overhauled and now follows the same
    interface style as the rest of the Swarm libraries.  New random bit
    generators and distributions are also available.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE!  The new random library requires changes to any code
    that used the old library.  A copy of the old library remains available
    for anyone who wants to put off making these changes.  See the
    instructions on porting to the new random library (in the random
    library documentation) for more information.

**  The swarmobject and random libraries both use a single header file to
    declare the public interface to the entire library (similar to the
    declarations for the defobj, collections, and activity libraries).  To
    use the public interface, you only need to include this single file,
    which contains just Objective C protocol definitions for public behavior
    rather than the @interface declarations of implementing classes.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE!  The new version of <swarmobject.h> requires that you
    must explicitly import a class header file if you want to subclass
    from it.  You are also restricted from use of class-based typing, since
    details of classes inside a library remain open to change.  See the
    instructions on porting apps to the nwe swarmobject interface (in the
    swarmobject library documentation) for more information.

**  A new version of the collections library has *not* been included in this
    release.  Major upgrade of the collections library is still imminent,
    but was excluded from this release due to the complexity of changes and
    the priority of more basic cleanup in the defobj and activity libraries.

    The new version of the collections library will include a new,
    general-purpose facility for subclassing from custom-generated classes,
    which will also be retrofitted to classes in defobj and activity.

**  There is an entirely new framework for mapping internal storage
    allocations made by an object.  User code that creates objects need
    not be aware of the new framework, but it is used heavily by the
    swarm foundation libraries to manage their internal storage.  The new
    framework will support future versions of zones that reclaim unused
    storage and that keep storage locally contained in their own pages.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE!  The dropFrom: message has been removed.  Even though
    it was still present in recent releases, its behavior was identical to
    drop.  Any existing usage should be replaced by a simple drop message
    without any zone argument.  SwarmObject subclasses are now restricted
    from accessing the zone that was once contained in an instance variable;
    the message getZone must be used instead.

**  Standard methods for printing a short description of any object have
    been established for debug purposes.  A default describe method is
    provided for all objects, and more detailed methods that print useful
    information are provided for many of the fundamental classes.  For
    example, zones print a summary of the total number and size of objects
    and other allocations, and collections have the ability to print all
    their members.  See defobj and debugging documentation for details.

**  Storage leaks have been eliminated from the most basic swarm libraries,
    including collections and activity.  The new allocation framework and
    debug print methods make it much easier to track down the existence of
    storage leaks (failure to reclaim unused storage) and to determine the
    code responsible.

**  Swarms now inherit from Zone in addition to defining their own behavior.
    This means that you can allocate objects directly inside a swarm, using
    the swarm as the argument of a create: or createBegin: message, instead
    of having to create or refer to a separate zone variable.

*** Swarms as zones means that a swarm can take total responsibility for
    the model of a world that makes up an experiment, including both
    objects that belong to the world and the schedule of actions to occur.
    A new message, getPopulation, returns a collection of all objects that
    have been created within a swarm or a zone but not yet dropped.

**  Any object now supports an ability to register an external reference to
    the object, and to have this reference notified (via the calling of a
    function) whenever the referenced object is dropped.  Registration of
    references will allow automatic dropping of probes when the objects they
    refer to disappear; currently such probes still crash.

**  An externally-supplied character string can now be associated with any
    object.  This character string is referred to as the "DisplayName" of
    the object and may be used to identify the object in a user-meaningful
    way when displaying the object for probe or debug purposes.

**  The defobj and activity libraries have had much obsolete or
    unimplemented behavior removed from their published interfaces.

*** The collections library has not been through this kind of cleanup yet.
    Its current capabilities remain limited to what is essential to the
    implementation of warms and schedules in the activity library.  The
    basic List and Array classes remain fairly complete and close to the
    advertised interface, but Map and Set don't even come close yet.

**  In the defobj library, methods inherited from the gcc Object
    superclass have been disabled if they don't work with the zone-based
    allocation required of all swarm objects.  These include the
    no-argument forms of alloc, free, and copy.  A compile-time option,
    -DINHERIT_OBJECT_WITH_ERRORS is available to test dependence on
    any method inherited from Object, since Swarm provides its own
    equivalents for almost all of these.  The exact extent of dependence
    on the built-in Object superclass will be reviewed in future releases.

**  The defobj library includes a new script, m2h, that can automatically
    maintain the method declarations in a .h file to precisely match the
    methods actually implemented in a corresponding .m file.

**  In the activity library, the Schedule type now supports the convenience
    messages create:setRepeatInterval: and create:setRelativeTime: for
    these common create options.  The same createAction messages defined
    for an action group (without the at: time value) are also defined for
    schedules, where they schedule the action at a default time of zero.
    These messages are a convenience for actions in a repeating schedule
    that all occur at a zero relative time.

**  The high-level structure of activity library interfaces has changed to
    incorporate additional action types in the future, but creatable objects
    and their messages all remain the same.  A new standard message,
    getActivity, will eventually replace the message getSwarmActivity on a
    Swarm; either message may be used for now.

**  The macro getCurrentActivity() is not currently supported due to a
    change in the level of activity that it would return.  All the macros
    that return activities at higher levels (e.g., getCurrentTime(),
    getCurrentSwarm(), and getTopLevelActivity()) remain available.
    Only these should be used to control a running activity (for example,
    to terminate a current activity).  All these macros now raise an error
    if used while an activity is not actually running.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE!  If you used the old getCurrentActivity() in your code,
    it won't work now.  Use of this macro was not very widespread, since its
    main use is to access activity library internals.  One of the other
    macros should be sufficient for any application.

**  In the swarmobject library, a convenience object, ActivityControl,
    has been added to help understand and manipulate activities.  It
    supports just the execution control messages (run, stop, step,
    terminate, etc.) for an activity that has already been created.

**  ProbeMaps no longer reorder their contents alphabetically.  The order
    is now the same as in the defining class.

**  Two new classes, QSort and NSelect have been added to the simtools
    library.  These package the ability to sort the members of a collection
    and to select a random member from the collection.

**  The ability to read and write unsigned types has been added to the
    InFile and OutFile classes of the simtools library.

* Swarm Beta Release Notes - Version 961002:

** Added Gaussian. Draws a uniform random number with a normal
      distribution around a given mean, standard deviation, and 
      seed. Soon there will be even more stuff thanks to Sven.
**  Added scrollbars to the probes.
**  Changed controlPanel functionality.  
       One implication is that instead of
           [controlPanel waitForControlEvent] 
       users that want to stop the simulation (from the software, e.g.
       to wait for the user to fill in datafields) should use 
           [controlPanel setStateStopped]

**  Added the method 
           -removeProbeDisplayFor: anObject
       to the ProbeDisplayManager class so that you may remove a probe
       display for an object without the probe id.
**  Added the long-awaited -batchmode flag!
**  New library <analysis.h> which contains the following new classes:
           EZBin.h EZDistribution.h EZGraph.h Entropy.h
       It also serve as a new home for the following class:
           Averager.h 
**  Upgraded Entropy and Average so that they can take any collection
       (not necessarily a list).
**  Fixed getAverage on Averager when the collection is empty.
**  The following classes have moved from <swarmobject.h> to <simtools.h>:
         ActiveGraph.h ActiveOutFile.h
**  The following _new_ classes have landed in <simtools.h>:
        InFile.h OutFile.h ObjectLoader.h ObjectSaver.h UName.h
**  Added new methods to Discrete2d:
        -fastFillWithValue: (int) aValue
        -fastFillWithObject: anObject
        -fillWithValue: (int) aValue
        -fillWithObject: anObject
**  Added new class (Int2dFiler.h) for filing of discrete2d spaces.
**  Added the CompleteVarMap class to the probing capabilities.
**  Added a message to the ProbeLibrary:
        -getCompleteVarMap: (Class) aClass
**  Added methods to the VarProbe class:
        -setNonInteractive 
        -(int) isInteractive 
**  Added methods to the Histo class (tkobjc):
        -drawHistoWithDouble: (double *) points 
                  atLocation: (double *) locations
        -drawHistoWithInt: (int *) points 
               atLocation: (double *) locations
