   			    The Swarm Team

The Swarm project was initiated by Chris Langton.  Roger Burkhart
(John Deere), Nelson Minar (now at Google), Glen Ropella, Manor
Askenazi (now at Coopers & Lybrand), Irene Lee, Vladimir Jojic (UIUC),
Alex Lancaster (UC Berkeley, formerly of SFI), Marcus Daniels (SFI),
and Scott Christley have all been active in the design and programming
of Swarm.

Swarm is currently maintained by the Swarm Development Group (SDG) and
the community, there is currently no lead developer or maintainer.

The MacOSX port is being led by Bill Northcott at UNSW, in Sydney
Australia (see macosx/README.MacOSX).
