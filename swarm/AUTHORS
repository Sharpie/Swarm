   			    The Swarm Team

The Swarm project is based at the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico.

The Swarm project was initiated by Chris Langton (now at the Swarm
Corporation).  Roger Burkhart (John Deere), Nelson Minar (now at the
MIT Media Lab), Glen Ropella (now at Swarm Corporation) and Manor
Askenazi have all been active in the design and programming of Swarm.
The current Swarm team at the SFI consists of Irene Lee, Marcus
Daniels and Alex Lancaster.

                                  Sincerely,
                                  The Hive at SFI
