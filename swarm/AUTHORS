   			    The Swarm Team

The Swarm project is based at the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico.

The Swarm project was initiated by Chris Langton (now at the Swarm
Corporation).  Roger Burkhart (John Deere), Nelson Minar (now at the
MIT Media Lab), Glen Ropella (now at Swarm Corporation) and Manor
Askenazi have all been active in the design and programming of Swarm.
The current Swarm team at the SFI consists of Irene Lee, Marcus
Daniels and Alex Lancaster.

The new random library was written by Sven Thommesen and graciously
contributed.  Eric Carr and JJ Merelo have been patient Swarm users
and developers. Howard Gutowitz and David Hiebeler have participated
in the design process.  (David is also the implementor of the original
Swarm prototype.)  And, many thanks to Simon Fraser, Swarm graphic
designer extraordinaire.  Finally, many thanks go out to the Swarm
user community, particularly those who have stuck with us from the
beginning.


                                  Sincerely,
                                  The Hive at SFI
