Welcome to the Swarm distribution. Full documentation should be found
in "swarmdocs-xxxxxx.tar.gz", in the same place as this distribution.
Documentation is also available on the Web at
  http://www.santafe.edu/projects/swarm/release/swarmdocs/

Full installation instructions are in the Swarm documentation. Very
briefly, you should edit Makefile.conf to point to the right
directories and run "make".

Questions about this release should be directed to <swarm-support@santafe.edu>
This is a mailing list shared by all beta developers.
