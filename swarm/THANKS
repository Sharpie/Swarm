The new random library was written by Sven Thommesen and graciously
contributed.  Eric Carr and JJ Merelo have been patient Swarm users
and developers. Howard Gutowitz and David Hiebeler have participated
in the design process.  (David is also the implementor of the original
Swarm prototype.)  And, many thanks to Simon Fraser, Swarm graphic
designer extraordinaire.  Finally, many thanks go out to the Swarm
user community, particularly those who have stuck with us from the
beginning.
