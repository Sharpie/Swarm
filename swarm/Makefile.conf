### Configure this file so Swarm knows about your environment. Some day
###   we will try to use GNU autoconf to do this for you.

### SETUP:  Canned setup for sites that build architecture-specific.  
### binaries (normal user use NONE and assign values to OTHERLIBDIRS
### and OTHERINCDIRS).  legal values: (NONE,SFI,nelson,umich);

### OTHERINCDIRS needs to be set so Swarm can find X11, tcl, tk, 
###   libtclobjc, and objc include files. Ie, <X11/Xlib.h>, <tcl.h>,
###   and <objc/Object.h> all need to be includable.
###

### OTHERLIBDIRS needs to be set so Swarm can find X11, Tcl, Tk, BLT,
###   tclobjc, and objc libs. Note: we use the file libtcl.a, not libtcl7.4.a
###   Insure that libtcl.a is really tcl7.4, libtk.a is really tk4.0.

### OTHERLIBS are other libraries you might need to link to compile
###   Swarm code. (-lsocket, for instance, or maybe -liberty).

### SYS: Induce canned options for a supported platform.  
### legal values: (solaris,hpux,linux,sgi)

### CONFIG: Use the distributed binary Swarm kernel (which has relevant
### portions of several system libraries linked into it), or use the
### local swarm library archives, along with local system libraries.
### legal values: (bin,archive)

### End of options you should need to configure. You can safely ignore
### everything below here, although experts might want to change these
### definitions (used to compile all swarm code.)

### Swarm code is installed in these three places
LIBDIR=$(SWARMHOME)/lib
INCDIR=$(SWARMHOME)/include
BINDIR=$(SWARMHOME)/bin

###
### In its simplest form, Swarm is compiled into a monolithic
### binary that encapsulates all of the tk/tcl and system files
### needed to link an application.
DISTOBJ=$(LIBDIR)/swarm.x

### These definitions are used for all compiles.
### You can override EXTRACFLAGS and EXTRALDFLAGS easily on the commandline
### Notes about specific flags:
###   -Wall is a good idea: it helps catch some easy errors.
###   -Wno-import turns off an annoying gcc feature
###   -O3 makes a big difference when running Swarm: when you get
###       serious, you want to build Swarm's libraries with optimization
###   -mv8 is a Sparc-specific optimization. On newer sparc chips, multiply
###        and divide (and hence, array access, random number generation, etc)
###        are about 30 times faster. (Old sparc chips will crash, however).

### All Swarm apps are linked against SWARMLIBS, SYSLIBS, and OTHERLIBS
### in addition, application Makefiles should put extra Swarm libraries
### in APPLIBS. Currently, there is one library you might want in APPLIBS,
### "-lspace". There are also contributed libraries that could go here.
