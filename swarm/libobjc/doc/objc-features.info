`+load': Executing code before main
===================================

   The GNU Objective-C runtime provides a way that allows you to execute
code before the execution of the program enters the `main' function.
The code is executed on a per-class and a per-category basis, through a
special class method `+load'.

   This facility is very useful if you want to initialize global
variables which can be accessed by the program directly, without
sending a message to the class first. The usual way to initialize
global variables, in the `+initialize' method, might not be useful
because `+initialize' is only called when the first message is sent to a
class object, which in some cases could be too late.

   Suppose for example you have a `FileStream' class that declares
`Stdin', `Stdout' and `Stderr' as global variables, like below:


     FileStream *Stdin = nil;
     FileStream *Stdout = nil;
     FileStream *Stderr = nil;
     
     @implementation FileStream
     
     + (void)initialize
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }
     
     /* Other methods here */
     @end

   In this example, the initialization of `Stdin', `Stdout' and
`Stderr' in `+initialize' occurs too late. The programmer can send a
message to one of these objects before the variables are actually
initialized, thus sending messages to the `nil' object. The
`+initialize' method which actually initializes the global variables is
not invoked until the first message is sent to the class object. The
solution would require these variables to be initialized just before
entering `main'.

   The correct solution of the above problem is to use the `+load'
method instead of `+initialize':


     @implementation FileStream
     
     + (void)load
     {
         Stdin = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:0];
         Stdout = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:1];
         Stderr = [[FileStream new] initWithFd:2];
     }
     
     /* Other methods here */
     @end

   The `+load' is a method that is not overridden by categories. If a
class and a category of it both implement `+load', both methods are
invoked.  This allows some additional initializations to be performed in
a category.

   This mechanism is not intended to be a replacement for `+initialize'.
You should be aware of its limitations when you decide to use it
instead of `+initialize'.

What you can and what you cannot do in `+load'
----------------------------------------------

   The +load implementation in the GNU runtime guarantees you the
following things:

   * you can write whatever C code you like;

   * you can send messages to Objective-C constant strings (@"this is a
     constant string");

   * you can allocate and send messages to objects whose class is
     implemented in the same file;

   * the `+load' implementation of all super classes of a class are
     executed before the `+load' of that class is executed;

   * the `+load' implementation of a class is executed before the
     `+load' implementation of any category.

   In particular, the following things, even if they can work in a
particular case, are not guaranteed:

   * allocation of or sending messages to arbitrary objects;

   * allocation of or sending messages to objects whose classes have a
     category implemented in the same file;

   You should make no assumptions about receiving `+load' in sibling
classes when you write `+load' of a class. The order in which sibling
classes receive `+load' is not guaranteed.

   The order in which `+load' and `+initialize' are called could be
problematic if this matters. If you don't allocate objects inside
`+load', it is guaranteed that `+load' is called before `+initialize'.
If you create an object inside `+load' the `+initialize' method of
object's class is invoked even if `+load' was not invoked. Note if you
explicitly call `+load' on a class, `+initialize' will be called first.
To avoid possible problems try to implement only one of these methods.

   The `+load' method is also invoked when a bundle is dynamically
loaded into your running program. This happens automatically without any
intervening operation from you. When you write bundles and you need to
write `+load' you can safely create and send messages to objects whose
classes already exist in the running program. The same restrictions as
above apply to classes defined in bundle.

Type encoding
=============

   The Objective-C compiler generates type encodings for all the types.
These type encodings are used at runtime to find out information about
selectors and methods and about objects and classes.

   The types are encoded in the following way:

`char'             `c'                                                    
`unsigned char'    `C'                                                    
`short'            `s'                                                    
`unsigned short'   `S'                                                    
`int'              `i'                                                    
`unsigned int'     `I'                                                    
`long'             `l'                                                    
`unsigned long'    `L'                                                    
`long long'        `q'                                                    
`unsigned long     `Q'                                                    
long'                                                                     
`float'            `f'                                                    
`double'           `d'                                                    
`void'             `v'                                                    
`id'               `@'                                                    
`Class'            `#'                                                    
`SEL'              `:'                                                    
`char*'            `*'                                                    
unknown type       `?'                                                    
bitfields          `b' followed by the starting position of the           
                   bitfield, the type of the bitfield and the size of     
                   the bitfield (the bitfields encoding was changed from  
                   the NeXT's compiler encoding, see below)               

   The encoding of bitfields has changed to allow bitfields to be
properly handled by the runtime functions that compute sizes and
alignments of types that contain bitfields. The previous encoding
contained only the size of the bitfield. Using only this information it
is not possible to reliably compute the size occupied by the bitfield.
This is very important in the presence of the Boehm's garbage collector
because the objects are allocated using the typed memory facility
available in this collector. The typed memory allocation requires
information about where the pointers are located inside the object.

   The position in the bitfield is the position, counting in bits, of
the bit closest to the beginning of the structure.

   The non-atomic types are encoded as follows:

pointers       `'^'' followed by the pointed type.                        
arrays         `'['' followed by the number of elements in the array      
               followed by the type of the elements followed by `']''     
structures     `'{'' followed by the name of the structure (or '?' if     
               the structure is unnamed), the '=' sign, the type of the   
               members and by `'}''                                       
unions         `'('' followed by the name of the structure (or '?' if     
               the union is unnamed), the '=' sign, the type of the       
               members followed by `')''                                  

   Here are some types and their encodings, as they are generated by the
compiler on a i386 machine:

Objective-C type   Compiler encoding                                      
     int a[10];    `[10i]'                                                
     struct {      `{?=i[3f]b128i3b131i2c}'                               
       int i;                                                             
       float f[3];                                                        
       int a:3;                                                           
       int b:2;                                                           
       char c;                                                            
     }                                                                    

   In addition to the types the compiler also encodes the type
specifiers. The table below describes the encoding of the current
Objective-C type specifiers:

Specifier          Encoding                                               
`const'            `r'                                                    
`in'               `n'                                                    
`inout'            `N'                                                    
`out'              `o'                                                    
`bycopy'           `O'                                                    
`oneway'           `V'                                                    

   The type specifiers are encoded just before the type. Unlike types
however, the type specifiers are only encoded when they appear in method
argument types.

Garbage Collection
==================

   Support for a new memory management policy has been added by using a
powerful conservative garbage collector, known as the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector. It is available from
`http://reality.sgi.com/employees/boehm_mti/gc.html'.

   To enable the support for it you have to configure the compiler
using an additional argument, `--enable-objc-gc'. You need to have
garbage collector installed before building the compiler. This will
build an additional runtime library which has several enhancements to
support the garbage collector. The new library has a new name,
`libobjc_gc.a' to not conflict with the non-garbage-collected library.

   When the garbage collector is used, the objects are allocated using
the so-called typed memory allocation mechanism available in the
Boehm-Demers-Weiser collector. This mode requires precise information on
where pointers are located inside objects. This information is computed
once per class, immediately after the class has been initialized.

   There is a new runtime function `class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()' which
can be used to declare a so-called *weak pointer* reference. Such a
pointer is basically hidden for the garbage collector; this can be
useful in certain situations, especially when you want to keep track of
the allocated objects, yet allow them to be collected. This kind of
pointers can only be members of objects, you cannot declare a global
pointer as a weak reference. Every type which is a pointer type can be
declared a weak pointer, including `id', `Class' and `SEL'.

   Here is an example of how to use this feature. Suppose you want to
implement a class whose instances hold a weak pointer reference; the
following class does this:


     @interface WeakPointer : Object
     {
         const void* weakPointer;
     }
     
     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p;
     - (const void*)weakPointer;
     @end
     
     
     @implementation WeakPointer
     
     + (void)initialize
     {
       class_ivar_set_gcinvisible (self, "weakPointer", YES);
     }
     
     - initWithPointer:(const void*)p
     {
       weakPointer = p;
       return self;
     }
     
     - (const void*)weakPointer
     {
       return weakPointer;
     }
     
     @end

   Weak pointers are supported through a new type character specifier
represented by the `'!'' character. The `class_ivar_set_gcinvisible()'
function adds or removes this specifier to the string type description
of the instance variable named as argument.
