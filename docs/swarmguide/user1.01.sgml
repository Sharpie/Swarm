  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The Swarm project was started in 1994 by Chris Langton at
  Santa Fe Institute (<acronym>SFI</acronym>)in New Mexico. The aim
  was to develop both a vocabulary and a set of standard computer
  tools for the development of multi-agent simulation models
  (so-called <acronym>ABM</acronym>s, short for Agent-Based Models).
  Armed with this framework, researchers are able to focus on the
  substance of the modeling task, avoiding some of the complicated
  (and uninteresting) details of computer coding.</para>

  <para>The Swarm project has benefitted from the contributions of
    many programmers, including Roger Burkhart, Nelson Minar, Manor
    Askenazi, Glen Ropella, Sven Thommesen, Marcus Daniels, Alex
    Lancaster, and Irene Lee. </para>

  <sect2><title>Basic facts about Swarm</title> <para>Swarm is a
    collection of software libraries which provide support for
    simulation programming. Among the most prominent features are the
    following.

	<listitem> <formalpara><title>Swarm Code is
          Object-Oriented.</title><para>The swarm
          libraries are written in a computer language called
          "Objective-C", a superset of the C language. Objective-C
          adds the ability to create software "classes" from which
          individual instances can be created.  These instances are
          self-contained entities, and the terminology of
          object-oriented programming turns out to be very well suited
          to discussions of agent-based models.</para>

            <para>Most swarm applications have a structure that
            roughly goes like this.  First, a top level--often called
            the "observer swarm"--is created.  That layer creates
            screen displays and it also creates the level below it,
            which is called the "model swarm".  The model swarm in
            turn creates the individual agents, schedulestheir
            activities, collects information about them and relays
            that information when the observer swarm needs it. This
            terminology is not required by Swarm, but its use does
            facilitate it. </para>

            <para>As we shall see in later sections, the Swarm
            libraries provide a number of convenient pieces of code
            that will facilitate the design of an agent-based
            model. These tools facilitate the management of memory,
            the maintenance of lists, scheduling of actions, and many
            other chores.</para>

    <para> Users build simulations by incorporating Swarm objects in
      their own programs.  Users are encouraged to study a number of
      tutorial examples in order to make full use of the Swarm
      libraries and the strategy of modeling that inspires
      them.</para>

<sect2><title>Swarm is a moving target</title>

    <para>Swarm is an "open source" project. {need some licensing frob
      here} </para>

    <para>Most of the development work has been done by the Swarm
      Development Group at the SFI.  Their results are periodically
      released on the internet and users can edit the source code.
      The creators fully intended for users to take the code,
      experiment with it, and propose changes and enhancements.  This
      open source strategy is designed to capture the contributions of
      a lively research community. When users make improvements in the
      libraries, they are encouraged to announce them to the community
      and make them available.  As a result of the interaction of the
      community and the Swarm team, the Swarm libraries are constantly
      being revised.</para>
    
    <para>To get an idea of how much things change, consider the brief
      history of the project. Swarm was originally intended for Unix
      operating systems that support the X Windows System.  The first
      beta version of Swarm was released in 1995.  In January, 1997,
      version 1.0 was released to the public.  It would run on Solaris
      and Linux operating systems.  Quickly after that, minor releases
      followed that opened up Swarm to the DEC Alpha platform and
      other flavors of Unix.  In April 1998, the reach of Swarm again
      broadened, as version 1.1 was released and, with the help of the
      Cygnus Win32 package, Swarm could be used on the Microsoft
      Windows 95/NT operating system.</para> <para>Because Swarm does
      grow and change as a result of the complex interaction within a
      research community, its precise path for development is not
      predictable.  Current priorities for the Swarm team at SFI
      include the further generalization of Swarm to be useful on a
      broader array of platforms and in conjunction with additional
      computer languages.

<title>Prerequisites for success with Swarm.</title>

    <para>Swarm was originally conceived as a set of standardized
      methods for the design of multi-agent simulation models. One
      need not be a highly-accomplished computer program to user the
      Swarm libraries.  In fact, as the installation process for Swarm
      becomes increasingly streamlined, it is quite easy for anyone
      with suitable hardware to test some of the sample
      applications. For people who have Windows 98/NT or Linux
      operating systems, compiled versions of the Swarm libraries are
      available and installation is quite painless</para>

    <para>However, it is not easy to create new Swarm
      applications. Doing so requires the creation of a computer
      program.  While one need not be an expert programmer, one must
      have a rudimentary understanding of vital computing
      concepts. The required knowledge will vary with the sort of
      model that one is intending to create, of course, but,<emphasis>
      at the bare minumum</emphasis>, users must have a basic
      understanding of computer programming, the C computer language,
      and Objective C. </para>
    
    <para>Fortunately, C is a highly-useful language and it is
      relatively easy to learn.  Objective-C is, well, truly elegant
      and fun to use and people who know C say it is fairly easy to
      learn. </para> <para> People who have not done computer
      programming will thus need to do some background preparation
      before they try to make a serious effort at building a Swarm
      model.  We suggest that the first step is to find one of the
      many elementary guides to computing with C, such as XXX or
      XXX. A manual with examples and exercises is vital.  These will
      teach the basics about writing code and compiling it into
      programs.  The book <citetitle pubwork="book">The C Programming
      Language</citetitle>, by the authors of C, <author>
      <firstname>Brian</firstname> <surname>Kernighan</surname>
      </author> and <author> <firstname>Dennis</firstname> <surname>
      Ritchie</surname> </author>, is a truly readable and informative
      manual that all users ought to investigate. The Objective-C
      language is best learned from the online book
      XXX.</para></sect2>

 <title>About This Guide</title> 

    <para> This Guide presents an overview of the Swarm simulation
      toolkit. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other
      materials, which include the sample programs and tutorials
      provided by the Swarm team and the Documentation Set.  Since
      this is a user guide, it is intended to be less formal and not
      so encyclopaedic as the Reference Manual. When there is any
      doubt, the Reference Manual (and the source code itself) is the
      final, most appropriate, authority.</para>

    <para>The inspiration for this Guide was provided
        by <author><firstname>Benedikt</firstname>
        <surname>Stefansson</surname></author>
        <email>benedikt@ucla.edu</email>, who prepared a series of
        lectures for the 1998 Swarmfest.  Benedikt generated a series
        of slides and illustrations and many of them have been adapted
        for this Guide. He has also provided help in the form of
        sample code and advice about many topics.</para>
