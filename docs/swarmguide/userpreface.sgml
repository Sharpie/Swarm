  <title>About this Guide</title>

  <para> This Guide presents an overview of the Swarm simulation
    toolkit. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other
    materials, which include the sample programs and tutorials
    provided by the Swarm team and the <citetitle>Swarm Documentation
    Set</citetitle>.  Since this is a user guide, it is intended to be
    less formal and not so encyclopaedic as the <citetitle>Reference
    Guide for Swarm</citetitle>. When there is any doubt, the
    <citetitle>Reference Guide</citetitle> (and the source code
    itself) is the final, most appropriate, authority.</para>

  <para>The inspiration for this Guide was provided by
    <author><firstname>Benedikt</firstname>
    <surname>Stefansson</surname></author>
    <email>benedikt@post.com</email>, who prepared a series of
    lectures for the 1998 and 1999 SwarmFests.  Benedikt generated a
    series of slides and illustrations and many of them have been
    adapted for this Guide. He has also provided help in the form of
    sample code and advice about many topics.</para>
