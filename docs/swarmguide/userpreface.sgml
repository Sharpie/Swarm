  <title>About this Guide</title>

  <para> This Guide presents an overview of the Swarm simulation
    toolkit. It is intended to be used in conjunction with other
    materials, which include the sample programs and tutorials
    provided by the Swarm team and the <citetitle>Swarm Documentation
    Set</citetitle>.  Since this is a user guide, it is intended to be
    less formal and not so encyclopaedic as the &refbook;. When there
    is any doubt, the <citetitle>Reference Guide</citetitle> (and the
    source code itself) is the final, most appropriate,
    authority.</para>

          <title>Part I</title> <para>An overview of Swarm and a brief
          primer on Swarm object-oriented programming using Objective
          C and Java.  <important>
              <para>At the time of writing only Part I
          has been written from a joint Objective C/Java perspective,
          subsequent Parts assume you are using the Objective C
          version of Swarm, a limitation we hope to rectify in future
          versions of this

    <email>benedikt@post.com</email>, who prepared a series of
    lectures for the 1998 and 1999 SwarmFests.  Benedikt generated a
    series of slides and illustrations and many of them have been
    adapted for this Guide. He has also provided help in the form of
    sample code and advice about many topics.</para>
