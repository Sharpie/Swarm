  <TITLE>Conclusion</TITLE>

  <PARA>Swarm tries to help computer simulation authors by making it
    easier to write simulations by making it more formal. The text
    above gives a narrative introduction into using Swarm for your own
    models, but a real understanding of Swarm will only come when you
    start to read through our examples and try to write your own
    applications. Good luck, and may your simulations be
    successful!</PARA>
