<TITLE>Supplemental comments on random number generators</TITLE>


<para>Please consider some additional warnings about the usage of random number generators</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <PARA>
          DO NOT use generators with bad statistical properties. See
           <link
          linkend="swarm.random.sgml.appendix-adv-usage.sect1">Advanced
          Usage Guide</link> for a discussion of the generators
          implemented in this library.</PARA>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <PARA>DO NOT use generators whose maximum cycle length is too
          short for the intended application; you don't want your
          generators to start repeating themselves. Be especially
          aware of this if you use the PMMLCGgen class of generator;
          these have good properties but a fairly short cycle. See
          <link
          linkend="swarm.random.sgml.appendix-adv-usage.sect1">Advanced
          Usage Guide</link> to read more about how to select a
          generator.</PARA>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><PARA>AVOID having generators in your simulation run
          in `lock-step', producing output that is statistically
          correlated. This may happen if you have several generators
          of the same class, all started with the same default
          seed.</PARA>

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <PARA>Be aware that even the best generators can have
          unexpected correlations with particular implementations of
          some models. As a result, in some cases using a "better"
          random number generator can result in worse (less correct)
          model behavior than one could obtain when using a "bad"
          generator. If you suspect your model may have this kind of
          problem, you probably should re-run some experiments using a
          different underlying generator, to make sure the results are
          (statistically at least) the same. (For examples of this,
          see the references <citation>Ferrenberg et al 1992</citation> and
          <citation>Nature 1994</citation>.)</PARA>
