    <ABSTRACT>

      <TITLE>A User's Guide for the Swarm Simulation System</TITLE>
      
      <PARA> This document began with the Swarm Tutorial presented at
        SwarmFests 1998 and 1999 by Benedikt Stefansson of CASA
        Inc. (formerly of UCLA Department of Economics). The Swarm
        Toolkit is discussed in three stages of increasing detail.
        The first part provides an introductory treatment and
        description of Swarm. The second part provides a deeper survey
        of the anatomy of a swarm program. The third part goes into
        significantly greater detail on some elements of programming
        in Swarm that users are likely to enounter as they build
        programs with Swarm. Users are encouraged to explore the Swarm
        sample programs and to visit the Swarm homepage, where they
        can find out the latest news and join the Swarm e-mail
        community.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Paul Johnson's effort on this project was supported in part
      by a grant from the National Science Foundation (SBR-9709404).
