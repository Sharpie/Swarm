    <ABSTRACT>

      <TITLE>A User's Guide for the Swarm Simulation System</TITLE>
      
      <PARA> This document began with the Swarm Tutorial presented at
        Swarmfest 1998 by Benedikt Stefansson of UCLA Department of
        Economics. The Swarm Toolkit is discussed in three stages of
        increasing detail.  The first part provides an introductory
        treatment and description of Swarm. The second part provides a
        deeper survey of the anatomy of a swarm program. The third
        part goes into significantly greater detail on some elements
        of programming in Swarm that users are likely to enounter as
        they build programs with Swarm. Users are encouraged to
        explore the Swarm sample programs and to visit the Swarm
        homepage, where they can find out the latest news and join the
        Swarm e-mail community.
