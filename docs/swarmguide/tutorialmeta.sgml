    </PARA>
    
    <PARA>The tutorial is presented in three parts: an Introduction to
          Swarm, a SimpleBug demo, and the Swarm Libraries.  The
          Introduction to Swarm covers the underpinnings and
          background information necessary to understand Swarm.  The
          SimpleBug demo is a walkthrough of converting a simple C
          code snippet into a Swarm application. Finally, the Swarm
          Libraries is an in depth look at the libraries that comprise
          the Swarm Simulation System.
