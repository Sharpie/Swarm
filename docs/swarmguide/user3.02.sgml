    <para>The most frequently used kinds of collections are the
      <classname>List</classname>, <classname>Map</classname> and
      <classname>Array</classname> protocols.  They have some elements
      in common. They all comply with the
      <classname>Collection</classname> protocol, most importantly,
      which means they have methods with which items can be added,
      retrieved, and removed.  Also, each can be used to create an
      index object, which can make management of lists an easier
      chore.
    </para>

    <para>It is very important to note that these collections are
      primarily intended to manage objects, not integers or floating
      point values.
      <footnote>
        <para>
          Type casting for both storage of variables in collections as
          well as usage of non-object values for keys was discussed in
          the original Swarm design.  Roger Burkhart defined a
          protocol <classname>MemberType</classname> which would have
          been adopted by the <classname>Collection</classname>
          protocol: <quote>The MemberType option may be used to
          declare the type of member which a collection contains.  Its
          value must be an object having one of the ValueType types
          defined in defobj.  (..Currently no ValueType objects are
          implemented, so MemberType is not supported.)</quote> This
          protocol was to have two methods: <function>-setMemberType:
          aDataType</function> and
          <function>-getMemberType</function>.</para>
      </footnote>

      If you need an array of integers (or floats or chars or whatever
      else), just use an ordinary C array.  When it is necessary to
      use strings, integers, or floating point values in a Swarm
      collection, there are two workarounds.  One is to use
      typecasting to put those other values inside the space allocated
      for a pointer to an object.  For various reasons, that approach
      is not as desirable as the alternative of creating "wrapper
      objects" that can contain those other types of variables. In
      short, while typecasting will often work, it is generally a
      better strategy is to design more carefully the objects you want
      to keep in Swarm collections and use recommended procedures for
      retrieving them.

    <para>This chapter does not discuss the Swarm

    <para>The different kinds of collections objects are useful for
      different purposes.  The <classname>List</classname> class can
      be used to create easy-to-use containers that make it relatively
      simple to manage iterative chores.  Use a Swarm
      <classname>List</classname> when you intend to have all objects
      processed in order, for example. (<classname>List</classname>s
      can also be processed in a randomized order).  The
      <classname>Map</classname> and <classname>Array</classname>
      classes are intended for more structured maintenance of
      collections.
    </para>

    <para>Because they serve these specialized objectives, there are
      some commands uniquely available to each of the Swarm container
      classes.  For example, as we saw in an earlier chapter, the
      <classname>List</classname> class can respond to methods like
      <function>addFirst:</function>, <function>addLast:</function>,
      removeFirst, and removeLast. A <classname>List</classname>
      object can be used in a flexible way, objects can be thrown onto
      the end or the beginning of the list with these methods.  These
      are not available in <classname>Map</classname> or
      <classname>Array</classname>, because <classname>Map</classname>
      and <classname>Array</classname> objects have more intricate
      internal structure.
    </para>

    <para>A Swarm <classname>Array</classname> object is used when it
      is necessary to store objects in a specific order.  The Swarm
      <classname>Array</classname> is somewhat similar to a C array,
      in the sense that objects can be inserted at a particular
      position and their values can be retrieved from that position.
      A Swarm <classname>Array</classname> can be processed
      iteratively, as a <classname>List</classname> can.</para>

    <para>A Swarm <classname>Map</classname> is used when objects are
      not stored according to their numerical position in a list, but
      rather according to the value of some object.  For example, a
      <classname>Map</classname> can store objects that have rankings
      of favorite foods for each of several people. If each person is
      an object, then the person's identity works as a "key" that
      controls the insertion and removal of the object from the
      <classname>Map</classname>.
    </para>

    <para>Enhancement and streamlining of the Swarm Collections
      library is an ongoing chore, but at the current time the user's
      choice of <classname>List</classname>,
      <classname>Map</classname>, or <classname>Array</classname> is
      partly driven by the way these classes are implented in Swarm.
      The <classname>List</classname> and <classname>Map</classname>
      classes are comparatively slow.  If one needs to make repeated
      accesses to a <classname>List</classname> or
      <classname>Map</classname> from randomly selected positions, the
      program will run comparatively slowly.  Here's why:

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem><para>
          Suppose you have a <classname>Map</classname> and you have
          entered objects that represent food tastes for each of 500
          people.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>
          If you then
          tell your <classname>Map</classname> object to retrieve the food
          preference of the person "Bart", for example, then the
          <classname>Map</classname> will be processed from the beginning
          (the first inserted object) and each will be checked to see if
          its key (its "owner," as it were) is "Bart."</para></listitem>  
        
        <listitem><para>
          If Bart's object happens to be at the end of the
          <classname>Map</classname>, then a lot of objects will be
          checked.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>
          Then, when you ask for the object of person "Fred", it
          begins at the start of the <classname>Map</classname> and
          checks, one-by-one, until it finds the object whose key is
          Fred.</para></listitem>

      </orderedlist>

      At the time of writing, the <classname>Map</classname> object,
      has no way to go straight to the one you want<footnote><para>a
      potential enhancement to the collections library is an option
      that would allow the user to select a hash-table implementation
      of the <classname>Map</classname> protocol, which would
      effectively allow this kind of random-access</para></footnote>,
      so it goes through this repetitive checking process.  The same
      is true of the <classname>List</classname> class.  As a result,
      if there are many objects, programs will run slowly when they
      try to insert and retrieve data for specific objects when using
      Swarm <classname>List</classname>s or
      <classname>Map</classname>s.
    </para>

    <para>In contrast, the processing of a Swarm
      <classname>Array</classname> can be quite fast because the
      elements are entered with integer keys.  A Swarm
      <classname>Array</classname> can quickly retrieve item number
      ten. Unlike a <classname>Map</classname>, it does not start at
      the beginning and go through a sequence of checks until it comes
      to the tenth item.  Because of the internal structuring of the
      Swarm <classname>Array</classname>, the tenth item is retrieved
      without checking the first nine.
    </para>

    <para>As a result of the aforementioned issue about the speed of
      the program, there is going to be a judgment call.  A
      <classname>Map</classname> will work fine and quickly if there
      are just a few items stored, but the time wasted looking for a
      specific item increases with the length of the list.  An
      <classname>Array</classname> might be a good choice, except
      allocating space for an array may waste memory.  For example,
      suppose we are preparing to survey 20 people out of a population
      of 100,000.  If each person is assigned a number, and then
      numbers are chosen at random, we might end up with people in our
      sample that are numbered {44, 63, 555, 4432, 6689, 21001, 44934,
      78343, 99921}.  If we use a <classname>Map</classname>, we could
      just add the 10 objects. On the other hand, if we wanted to use
      an <classname>Array</classname> with the person's number serving
      as the <classname>Array</classname> index, we would have to
      allocate an <classname>Array</classname> with 100,000 elements
      in order to store these ten items.  This wastes memory, but
      objects can indeed be retrieved quickly.  Most people would
      prefer a <classname>Map</classname> for this purpose.  If there
      were 10,000 people being sampled, however, the
      <classname>Array</classname> might work best.
    </para>

    <title>Using Swarm <classname>Array</classname>s</title> 

    <indexterm><primary>collections</primary><secondary>arrays</secondary><tertiary>usage</tertiary></indexterm>

    <para>The Swarm <classname>Array</classname> is the easiest to use
      of the Swarm collections. At create-time, the size of the
      <classname>Array</classname> is set.  For example, to create an
      <classname>Array</classname> called <varname>foods</varname>
      that has 15 elements, this code will get the job done:</para>

<programlisting> 
id &lt;Arraya&gt; foods; 
food=[Array create: [self getZone] setCount: 15];</programlisting>

    <para>If it is necessary to add elements to the
      <classname>Array</classname>, then the
      <function>setCount:</function>method of the
      <classname>Array</classname> class can be used to increase the
      size ofthe <classname>Array</classname>.
    </para>

    <para>Entries are inserted, accessed, and removed from the
      <classname>Array</classname> in a rather obvious way.  As in C,
      the numbering of the <classname>Array</classname> elements
      begins with 0, so the last element in the
      <classname>Array</classname> has the index value 14. To insert
      an object called <varname>steak</varname> into the foods
      <classname>Array</classname> at index value 6, the appropriate
      command is:
    </para>
    
    <programlisting> 
[foods atOffset: 6 put: steak];</programlisting>

    <para>
      When it is necessary to retrieve the <varname>steak</varname>
      object, this will do:
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>
retrievedObject=[foods atOffset: 6];</programlisting>

    <para>
      A Swarm <classname>Array</classname> object will allow quick
      access of any particular object because the objects are indexed
      by an integer.
    </para>
    
    <para>
      An <classname>Array</classname> will work like a Swarm
      <classname>List</classname> for the purposes of repetitive
      processing. Since an <classname>Array</classname> includes a
      fixed number of objects, they can easily be accessed with for
      loops, but while loops will work just as well.  An
      <classname>Array</classname> object can be told to create an
      index object for itself, and that index can be used in the way
      that we described in the chapter on
      <classname>List</classname>s.
    </para>

    <para> There is only one surprise awaiting users of the
      <classname>Array</classname> protocol: objects cannot be removed
      from <classname>Array</classname>s.  Since the
      <classname>Array</classname> protocol's major strength is its
      speed, and the speed depends on maintaining a fixed list of
      items, the remove method of the Collections protocol is disabled
      in <classname>Array</classname>.  Rather than remove an item
      from an <classname>Array</classname>, one must put
      <varname>nil</varname> at a position in the
      <classname>Array</classname>.  This achieves the same effect as
      remove, but it preserves the <classname>Array</classname>
      "placeholder" so that future objects can be inserted at that
      spot.

    <title>Swarm <classname>Map</classname>s</title> 

    <indexterm><primary>collections</primary><secondary>maps</secondary><tertiary>usage</tertiary></indexterm>

    <para>Experienced programmers are familiar with the term "key" as
      it refers to management of collections.  People who are new to
      programming and Swarm often find this idea quite confusing.
      Hence, we will explain.</para>

    <para>Think of a <classname>Map</classname> as two rows of
      objects.  The bottom row contains the objects you want to store
      and retrieve.  The top row contains the names of the objects.
      If you put an object into a <classname>Map</classname>, you tell
      the <classname>Map</classname> its name and the
      <classname>Map</classname> handles the problem of inserting the
      object into the bottom row and putting the name in the top row.
      When an object is removed from a <classname>Map</classname>, its
      name is also removed from the top row.  If you need to get an
      object, you tell the <classname>Map</classname> its name and the
      <classname>Map</classname> then goes to the right position in
      the top row and then it gives back the corresponding object in
      the bottom row.
    </para>
    
    <para>The names of the objects are called "keys" in Swarm (and
      other programming languages). The usage of keys is somewhat
      confusing and difficult for newcomers because the keys should be
      Swarm objects. </para>

    <example>
      <title>Maps and keys</title>

      <indexterm><primary>collections</primary><secondary>maps</secondary><tertiary>keys</tertiary></indexterm>
      <para>Here is a simple example.  Suppose we are creating a
        series of objects in a for loop.  In each step, we tell the
        class Person, which is subclassed from
        <classname>SwarmObject</classname> to create an instance
        <varname>aFriend</varname> and we add that Person to a
        <varname>listOfPeople</varname>.  Then we tell the class
        Preferences to create an instance and we insert the instance
        into a <classname>Map</classname>, using the Person object as
        the key. Note that the <classname>Map</classname> and
        <classname>List</classname> are declared before the loop.
        </para>

      <programlisting>

id &lt;List&gt; listOfPeople;
id &lt;Map&gt; mapOfPreferences;
listOfPeople=[List create: [self getZone]];
mapOfPreferences=[Map create: [self getZone]];

for(i=0; i &lt; 50; i++)
{
id aFriend, aPreference;
aFriend = [Person createBegin: [self getZone]];
aFriend = [aFriend createEnd];

[listOfPeople addLast: aFriend];

aPreference = [Preferences createBegin: [self getZone]];
aPreference = [aPreference createEnd];

[mapOfPreferences at: aFriend insert: aPreference];
}</programlisting>

      <para>
        To retrieve a preference object, it is first necessary to
        figure out which person you want and then tell the
        <classname>Map</classname> to return that person's preference.
        For example, suppose you decide to grab the 6th person and
        find out what their preferences are.  Then try this:
      </para>
      
      <programlisting>
id aParticularPerson, thePreference;
aParticularFriend=[listOfPeople atOffset: 6];
thePreference=[mapOfPreferences at: aParticularFriend];
// here you can do anything you want to with thePreference you get back.</programlisting>
      
      <para>Similarly, you could cycle through the
        <varname>listOfPeople</varname> by creating a Swarm index for
        the <varname>listOfPeople</varname> and then use the returned
        value from <literal>[index next]</literal> as the key:
      </para>

<programlisting>
id index, aPerson;
index= [listOfPeople begin: [self getZone]];
while( (aPerson=[index next])!=nil )
{
  id thePreference;
thePreference = [mapOfPreferences at: aPerson];
// here you insert some code that does something with the retrieved preference!
}</programlisting> 
    </example>

    <para>This example works because the <classname>Map</classname>
      object automatically compares the objects acting as keys to see
      if they are identical. This is the default compare: method of
      the class <classname>SwarmObject</classname>. If one wishes to
      compare the objects by another criterion, then a comparison
      function can be declared when the <classname>Map</classname> is
      created.  Lacking a user-defined comparison function, the
      <classname>Map</classname> will always use the
      <function>compare:</function> that is defined in the key object.
      Lacking such a function, the program should not run.
    </para>

    <para>When an object that is being used as a key has a
      <function>compare:</function> function, then the
      <classname>Map</classname> will use that function to decide if
      the two objects are equal.  If a comparison function is declared
      when the <classname>Map</classname> is created, then that
      comparison function will be used instead.  Swarm includes some
      built-in comparison functions, but, as we will see, the usage of
      customized functions is quite easy and convenient. If no
      comparison function is declared, then the fall-back approach
      checks for a <function>compare:</function> method in the key
      object itself. Since all objects that are based on Swarm inherit
      from the defined object class, all such objects have (at least)
      access to the bare minimum <function>compare:</function> that
      checks to see if two objects are identical.  Classes from which
      key objects are created can, of course, create more informative
      comparison methods.</para>
      
    <para>Lets begin with the problem of using integers as keys.
      There are two possible approaches, typecasting and the creation
      of "integer wrappers."  The typecasting approach is used in many
      Swarm applications. The essence of this approach is to use type
      casting to trick the Swarm library to make it treat an integer
      <emphasis>as if</emphasis> it were an object.  Without going too
      deeply into the computer science of the issue, it may not be
      possible to explain this, but we will take a stab at it.  On
      many computer systems, a pointer uses the same amount of space
      as an integer. Hence, it is possible to cast an integer as a
      pointer to "fool" the compiler, and then to retrieve the value
      of the integer from the place in memory where the pointer was
      supposed to be. (Confusing? Many users say, yes!)  Instead of
      inserting objects into a <classname>Map</classname> with objects
      as keys, using this casting trick, one can insert objects at
      integer values that are cast as objects of type <type>id</type>.
      For example:
    </para>

      <programlisting>
[mapOfPreferences at: (id) 13 insert: aFriend]</programlisting>

    <para>
      In order for this to work, the
      <varname>mapOfPreferences</varname> has to be created so that it
      knows integers are going to be passed through in this way. At
      create time, the <classname>Map</classname> must be told to use
      the built-in comparison function that will uncast the pointers
      and compare them.</para>

      <programlisting>
mapOfPreferences  = [Map createBegin: aZone];
[mapOfPreferences  setCompareFunction: compareIntegers];
mapOfPreferences = [mapOfPreferences createEnd];</programlisting>

    <para>The GridTurtle code example <filename>grid3b.m</filename>
      uses this appoach.
    </para>

    <para>This "casting" approach to creating a keys has some serious
      shortcomings.  Most importantly, it is severely nonportable.
      Code written in this way on a Linux system might not work on a
      DEC Unix system. Why?  On DEC Unix, an integer and a pointer do
      not have the same size.</para>

    <para>What is the alternative if one wants to enter objects into a
      <classname>Map</classname> using integers as keys? The answer
      is: create an "integer wrapper" class.  This integer wrapper can
      store and retrieve the values of integers, and these objects can
      be used as keys in Swarm <classname>Map</classname>s.
    </para>

    <indexterm><primary>wrapper</primary><secondary>integer wrapper as map key</secondary></indexterm>

    <para>Here is the integer wrapper class <footnote> <para>There is
        an example of a program by Marcus Daniels that uses integer
        wrappers at <ulink
        url="http://lark.cc.ukans.edu/~pauljohn/SwarmFaq/WorkingExampleCode/MapIntegerIndex.txt">MapIntegerIndex.txt</ulink>.</para>

    <para>In order to use the <classname>Integer</classname> class
      keys, the <classname>Map</classname> has to be told how to
      compare them, so it knows when it has found a key that matches
      what it is searching for.  In the example, the comparison
      function is called <function>compareIntegerObjects (
      )</function> and it takes two objects, and it then retrieves the
      value from each object, and returns the difference of the two. When 0
      is returned, it is treated as a "match". The following code snip
      creates 50 <classname>Preference</classname> objects and it
      creates an <classname>Integer</classname> object for each one.
      Each time the user wants to insert an object into a
      <classname>Map</classname>, an <classname>Integer</classname>
      wrapper is created.</para>

      <programlisting>
#include Integer.h
#include Preference.h

// Here is a "comparison function"
int
compareIntegerObjects (id obj1, id obj2)
{
return ((Integer *) obj1)->value - ((Integer *) obj2)->value;
}

id &lt;List&gt; listOfPeople;
id &lt;Array&gt; arrayOfIntegers;
id &lt;Map&gt; mapOfPreferences;

mapOfPreferences = [[[Map createBegin: [self getZone]]
    setCompareFunction: compareIntegerObjects]
   createEnd];

for (i = 0; i &lt; 50; i++)
{
  id aPreference;

  aPreference = [Preference createBegin: [self getZone]];
  aPreference = [aPreference createEnd];

  anInteger = [[Integer createBegin: [self getZone] setValue: i] createEnd];

  [mapOfPreferences at: anInteger insert: aPreference];
}</programlisting>

    <para> After the <varname>mapOfPreferences</varname> is filled
      with objects, then they can be retrieved by their key
      values. One can create a single <classname>Integer</classname>
      object, and then insert a value into it, and then use it as the
      key. The following will work to retrieve the
      <classname>Preference</classname> object corresponding to the
      <classname>Integer</classname> key with value 23.  Supposing the
      <classname>Preference</classname> class has a method
      <varname>outputVitalInfo</varname>, this will retrieve those
      objects and tell them to execute that method.
    </para>
    
    <programlisting>
id desiredPreferenceObject;

Integer * key = INTEGER(0);
key-&gt;value =23;   //same as [key setValue: 23];
desiredPreferenceObject= [mapOfPreferences at: key];
printf("The preference Object gives this output \n");
[desiredPreferenceObject outputVitalInfo];</programlisting>

    <para>This is written out this way to make the code as clear as
      possible.  The example program cited above includes a number of
      macro definitions that can be used to make working with the
      <classname>Integer</classname> class more elegant (and less
      tedious).
    </para>

    <para>The same kind of approaches can be used if one wants to use
      strings as keys in a <classname>Map</classname>.  The easiest
      way to use strings as the keys is to use the Swarm
      <classname>String</classname> protocol to create objects that
      act as "wrappers" for the string names. In the Swarm
      Documentation, one can find the GridTurtle test programs for the
      Collections library.  The file <filename>grid3.m</filename>
      contains an example that does exactly this.  The code in
      <filename>grid3.m</filename> creates a string, equal to the
      index variable i, and then sets that string into a
      <classname>String</classname> object, which is in turn used as
      the key. Of course, there is no reason that the chosen character
      string had to be a simple number. If you want to, you can create
      strings for all your friends and wrap them inside
      <classname>String</classname> objects.
    </para>

    <para>Unless you define a comparison function, the String objects
      are compared according to the <function>compare:</function>
      method that is defined for Swarm <classname>String</classname>s.
      This function is defined in the Swarm library in the file
      <filename>StringObject.m</filename>.  The comparison uses the C
      function strcmp to find out if the object's own string is the
      same as the string retrieved from the other object (which is
      called <varname>aString</varname>):
    </para>

<programlisting>- (int)compare: aString
{
  return strcmp (string, ((String_c *) aString)->string);
}</programlisting>

    <para>
      As in the case of integers, the built-in compare: method can be
      over-ridden by a customized comparison function declared by the
      user.

    <title>Accessing Collections with Indices</title>

   

    <para>Any collection can generate an <classname>Index</classname>
      that can be used to access its members.  The command to create
      an <classname>Index</classname> for a given collection is
      <function>begin:</function>.  The type of
      <classname>Index</classname> created by a collection depends on
      the type of collection being indexed. If one desires an index of
      randomly shuffled members of a collection, then
      <function>beginPermuted:</function> is the necessary command.
    </para>


    <indexterm><primary>collections</primary><secondary>index usage</secondary></indexterm>
    <para> An <classname>Index</classname> object will understand
      messages like <function>get</function>, which will return the
      object at which the <classname>Index</classname> is currently
      positioned, <function>next</function>, which will move the
      <classname>Index</classname> object to the next object in the
      collection and return that object, and
      <function>findNext:</function> objectName, which will cause the
      <classname>Index</classname> object to search forward into the
      collection until it finds an object that is the same as
      objectName.</para>

    <para> The usage of indexes can make some code work more smoothly.
      For example, as we noted in our discussion of
      <classname>List</classname>s, the <classname>Index</classname>
      can be used to orchestrate the repetitive processing of a
      <classname>List</classname> object in the following way:</para>

      <programlisting>
id aCollection;
id &lt;Index&gt; index;
aCollection = [List create: [self getZone]];
index =  [aCollection begin: [self getZone]];5

while( (anObject=[index next]) != nil )
{
  //write code that does something to anObject
}</programlisting>

    <para> This code will cycle through the
      <classname>List</classname>. Because the
      <classname>Index</classname> object remembers its position in
      the <classname>List</classname>, the processing is efficient in
      the sense that the <function>next</function> command causes just
      one step to be taken. This is a sharp contrast with the usage of
      collections methods like <literal>[aCollection atOffset:
      i]</literal>, which cause the <classname>List</classname> to
      begin at the beginning and count up to the
      <varname>i</varname>th object.
    </para>

    <para>Perhaps the most significant advantage of indices is that
      they can be used manage collections.  If items are removed from
      a collection by its <classname>Index</classname> object, then
      the <classname>Index</classname> object is automatically kept up
      to date. On the other hand, if items are removed directly by
      collections methods, such as <literal>[aCollection remove:
      thisObject]</literal>, then the indexes that had been previously
      created for that <classname>List</classname> will be damaged and
      they must be dropped and recreated.  On the other hand, if an
      <classname>Index</classname> is positioned on the desired
      member, and then the index is told to remove that object, then
      the change will be made in the collection and the index will
      automatically be adjusted.</para>

    <para>In order to make an index remove objects correctly, the
      fundamental problem is to correctly position the index within
      the collection. To make an index object reposition itself at the
      beginning of the collection, the command <literal>[index setLoc:
      Start]</literal> can be used. <Classname>Index</Classname>
      objects can be manually positioned with methods like
      <literal>[index findNext: targetObject]</literal> or
      <literal>[setOffset: i]</literal>. These will, respectively,
      move to the next object which, according to the comparison
      function, matches the target object, or move the index to the
      <varname>i</varname>th object in the collection. Once the index
      is positioned, then the object can be removed with
      <literal>[index remove]</literal>.
    </para>

    <para>The Swarm <classname>List</classname> class creates
      <classname>Index</classname> objects that have more
      functionality than the other classes.  The
      <classname>Index</classname> of a <classname>List</classname>
      class collection can be used to insert objects as well as delete
      them.  For example, <literal>[index addAfter:
      newObject]</literal> can set a new object into a collection
      after the object currently under the index.  The addition of
      objects by the index is not allowed in Swarm
      <classname>Array</classname>s or <classname>Map</classname>s
      because of the internal structure of those classes.
