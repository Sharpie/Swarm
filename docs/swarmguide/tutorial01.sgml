    <TITLE>An Overview of Swarm</TITLE>

    <PARA>Swarm is a collection of software libraries which provide
      support for simulation programming.  Swarm users build
      simulations by incorporating Swarm objects in their own
      programs.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>The Swarm libraries are written in the Objective-C language.
      The scripting language used to generated the graphical user
      interface is Tcl/Tk.  This GUI may be substituted by the Java
      AWT widget set in the future.  Swarm runs under X-Windows/Unix
      and WindowsNT operating systems.

    <TITLE>The History of Swarm</TITLE>

    <PARA>The Swarm Simulation System started in 1994 by Chris Langton
      at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico.  The founding
      developers were Chris Langton, Roger Burkhart, Nelson Minar,
      Manor Ashkenazi and Glen Ropella.  The current members of the
      Swarm Team are Marcus Daniels, Alex Lancaster and Irene Lee.
      Many additional contributions were made by members of the Swarm
      Community at large.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>The objective of the Swarm Program was to create a common simulation
     platform for Agent based Modelling. 

      Add:
      -unneccessary duplication of effort
      -shared models and ideas
      -repeatable experiments
      -common simulation base
      
    </PARA>

    <PARA>Swarm was first released in 1995 (Beta version). The 1.0
      release occured in January 1997 followed by version 1.1 in April
      of 1998.
