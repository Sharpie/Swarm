<preface id="SWARM.COMPATIBILITY.SGML.PREFACE">  <title>Swarm Changes and Compatibility</title>

  <sidebar>    <title>Notes on Porting</title>
    
    <para>New versions provide new features, but may have the
      unfortunate side-effect of breaking many existing
      applications. This document is intended to provide a
      step-by-step guide to updating your Swarm applications to use
      the latest version as quickly and painlessly as possible.
    </para>

    <para>This document contains detailed examples for porting
      versions equal to, or later than, Swarm 1.0.5.
    </para>

    <para>Users trying to port from versions
      <emphasis>earlier</emphasis> than 1.0.5, are advised to first
      view the compatibility section of the 1.0.5 swarmdocs.  First
      perform those changes in sequence, (i.e. if you have apps
      compatible with Swarm 1.0.3 - first make the 1.0.3 =&gt; 1.0.4
      changes, followed by the 1.0.4 =&gt; 1.0.5 changes) and then
      perform the changes described here. You may notice that some of
      the changes overlap as earlier versions may have merely
      deprecated some functionality, whilst later versions actually
      disabled it. This has been done to phase new functionality in,
      and old functionality out over several releases, so the user
      isn't hit with an enormous burden every minor release.
    </para>

    <para>We intend that most application changes should be covered,
      but given that we can never know in advance how a user has
      employed the software, we cannot guarantee that all potential
      application changes will be covered in the document explicitly.

    <sect2>      <title>Major changes</title>

      <para>There are really only two main changes which are likely to
        affect existing users, and all other changes required in
        user's applications mostly flow from these two changes:
      </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>          <para>All Swarm functionality is now exported through a
            single, well-defined interface: Objective C protocols.
            Essentially this means that all creatable or subclass-able
            protocols now follow the same conventions as those in the
            defobj, activity and collections libraries.  This means
            that static typing of Swarm protocols is now obsolete
            across the whole package.</para></listitem>

        <listitem>          <para>Library header files no longer include any of their
            individual class header files.</para></listitem>

        <listitem>          <para>The <classname>XPixmap</classname> protocol has now
            been changed to <classname>Pixmap</classname> to divorce
            itself from it's association with
            X-Windows.</para></listitem>

      </itemizedlist>

    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>      <title>Porting Guide</title>

      <itemizedlist>        <listitem><para>Any subclass of a class defined as a Swarm
          protocol now requires the *specific* importation of that
          protocol's header file.  Previously, only a warning was
          raised.  This particularly affects
          <classname>Swarm</classname> and
          <classname>SwarmObject</classname>.  If you define something
          like:

<programlisting>  @interface MyObject: SwarmObject</programlisting>

  then you need to include:

<programlisting>  #import objectbase/SwarmObject.h</programlisting>
 
          Similarly, if you subclass from Swarm, you will require
            <filename>objectbase/Swarm.h</filename> </para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>All references to objects conforming to Swarm
          protocols should either be defined to conform to the
          appropriate Swarm protocol, or be left untyped.  In no
          circumstance should it be statically typed.  In practice,
          this means that you can write, either:

<programlisting> 
   id Grid2d world;  OR
   id world;</programlisting>

    but NOT

<programlisting>   Grid2d *world;</programlisting>
 
            Note that this only applies to protocols defined by Swarm
            proper, not to your own classes, although it is good
            practice to adopt a convention and stick to it.

    <sect2>      <title>Major changes</title>

      <para> The major changes which are likely to affect existing
      users are the following:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>Addition of a new library class "gui" which replaces
          the existing "tkobjc" library.</para></listitem>
        
        <listitem><para>All direct references to any Tcl/Tk code such as the
          "globalTkInterp" variable have been completely removed from
          any library code and should not be used in any
          application.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para> Splitting of simtools into two separate libraries:
          simtools and simtoolsgui.  Classes that intrinsically depend
          on a GUI toolkit being present (either Tcl/Tk or Java AWT)
          were put into simtoolsgui.  This allows a user who never
          intends to use a GUI toolkit, to be able to compile, link
          and run Swarm applications <emphasis>without any</emphasis>
          GUI toolkit installed at all.  This was not previously
          possible.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para> The above change has been made possible by the fact
          that the dependency of Tcl/Tk in the Probing mechanism has
          been completely removed. It has been replaced by the
          libffi/ffcall libraries.  Other than the fact that the user
          will need to install this new library if they are not using
          a binary distribution, this new dependence should
          <emphasis>not</emphasis> break any user code.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para> The header file to the random library is no longer
          included in simtools.h you need to explicitly import
          random.h when you use a default random number
          generator.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>The XColormap class is now just Colormap to divorce
          it from its association with X-Windows.  Similarly, BLTGraph
          is now just Graph.</para></listitem>
        
        <listitem><para>The class named Histo is now named
            Histogram.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>Certain classes now enforce their defining by the
            protocol method.  For example an instance of the Raster
            class must be defined as <literal>(id Raster
              r)</literal> rather than <literal>(Raster *
              r)</literal>.</para></listitem>

    <title>Porting from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1</title>

    <para>There should not be any imcompatibilities between 1.0.1 and
      1.0.0. There are a couple of changes that affect the behavior of
      Swarm, however. The big ones are:

        <listitem><para>The automatic dropping of probe displays upon
            the dropping of an object to which those probe displays
            were attached. This could break your application code if
            you leave in the
            <programlisting>dropProbeDisplaysFor:</programlisting>
            message where you drop such an object.</para></listitem>

        <listitem><para>The default probeMap has changed. This is only
            an issue when
            <programlisting>createProbeDisplayFor:</programlisting> is
            called without having previously created and installed a
            probeMap for that class. The new behavior is to create a
            probeMap on-the-fly that contains only the instance
            variables for that class.</para></listitem>

  <sect1>    <title>Beta to 1.0.0</title>

    <para>As can be expected with any software package, it is sometimes
      unavoidable that changes in the functionality of the package will
      cause incompatibilities with earlier versions. This is especially true
      when a package is a "proof-of-principle" package like Swarm.</para>
