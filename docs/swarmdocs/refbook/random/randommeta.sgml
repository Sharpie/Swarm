    <PARA>This is version 0.75 of Random. It was donated by Sven
      Thommesen.  Version 0.6 was a reimplementation of most of Nelson
      Minar's original random with many changes and a new
      interface. This version adds many more generators and
      distributions and changes the interface somewhat.</PARA>

    <PARA>The implementation may be a little unstable. It hasn't been
      fully tested.  Sven has also contributed a test suite which we
      will make available on the web site. But, as with any
      pseudo-random number generation library, results obtained from
      it should be examined very closely. But we are reasonably sure
      the generators and distributions have been correctly
      implemented.</PARA>
