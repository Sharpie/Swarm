    <TITLE>Documentation and Implementation Status</TITLE>

    <PARA>This is version 0.8 of Random. It was donated by Sven
      Thommesen.  Version 0.6 was a reimplementation of most of Nelson
      Minar's original random with many changes and a new
      interface. Versions 0.7 and 0.75 added many more generators and
      distributions and changed the interface somewhat. This version
      cleaned up the protocol interface definitions and fixed a few
      small bugs. The documentation was also improved a bit.</PARA>

    <PARA>We are reasonably sure that the generators and distributions
      included here have been correctly implemented. The generators
      have been subjected to a battery of statistical tests, and the
      results are described in the documentation. The distributions
      have not been subjected to statistical tests yet. As with any
      pseudo-random number generation library, the results obtained
      should be examined closely. A set of test programs which 
      exercises the objects is available on the Swarm web site, and
      the statistical tests are also available on the web.</PARA>
