    <PARA>First, a few thoughts on random number generation. It's hard
      to do right! The root cause, of course, is that computer
      algorithms themselves are not truly random. (Hence this library
      contains pseudo-random generators only.)

      There are many problems in implementing algorithms correctly and
      efficiently, and in coming up with good tests for generators and
      distributions. The history of pseudorandom number generation in
      simulation work is mostly embarrassing. This library attempts to
      do a decent job of generating random numbers, as well as
      documenting how things work and what shortcomings there are.

      If you want to learn more about random number generation, the
      bibliography has useful notes (see <link
      linkend="swarm.random.sgml.bibliography">Bibliography</link>)
      Knuth is the main reference in this realm, but too old to
      describe most of the particular generators used here, many of
      which are drawn from recent literature.

    <PARA>The <EMPHASIS>objectbase</EMPHASIS> library interface is
      included to provide the basic object
      support. <FILENAME>randomdefs.h</FILENAME> contains some C
      preprocessor macros and typedefs used in the library.</PARA>

    <PARA>This reference guide contains the object definitions
      for generators and distributions (see the list above) 
      and also encodes the
      inheritance structure through the "Protocols that this protocol
      uses" section of each protocol. 

      Just click on a (sub-)protocol name to see what methods it
      implements. (You may want to review the section on Protocols in
      the Objective-C book here!)

    </PARA>

    <para>In the protocols described, any protocol that ultimately
      inherits from CREATABLE defines an object that you can use in
      your program. (This is part of the Swarm defobj machinery.) In
      other words, while 'InternalState' is a normal protocol (a list
      of method definitions), the name `ACGgen' refers to both a
      protocol and a class that implements that protocol. (You create
      an ACG generator by saying <FUNCTION>myGen = [ACGgen create:
      ....]).</FUNCTION> Similarly, 'GammaDist' defines both a protocol 
      and a class that implements that protocol.</para>

    <para>All generators and distributions ultimately inherit from
      SwarmObject.</para>

      <PARA>The <EMPHASIS>random</EMPHASIS> library contains two kinds
        of objects, the <EMPHASIS>generators</EMPHASIS> which implement
        different pseudo-random-number algorithms, and the 
        <EMPHASIS>distributions</EMPHASIS> which transform the (uniform)
        output from the generators into the desired simulated statistical
        distributions. Note that the Swarm random library does not

        at this time.
