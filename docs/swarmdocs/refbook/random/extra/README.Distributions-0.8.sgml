<title>Implementation notes for Distributions</title>

<formalpara><title>Changes over v. 0.75</title>

<para>No functional changes were made. Code was rearranged to conform
to create-phase protocol (CREATING-SETTING-USING) ordering.</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Improvements over v. 0.6</title><para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>One new distribution class, BernoulliDist, has been
added. It returns binary values (yes/true/1) with a given probability
(while the old RandomBitDist has a fixed 50% probability, a fair coin
toss.)</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Distributions now have a new create method,
'+createWithDefaults: aZone'.  This method creates the distribution
object, and also a new generator object for its exclusive use. Each
distribution class has a different default generator class
assigned. These generators are initialized with STARTSEED, which by
default equals the fixed value DEFAULTSEED, but will be equal to the
varying RANDOMSEED if you start your program with the command line
parameter <option>--varyseed</option> or
<option>-s</option>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>All distributions have code to interact with the new
`split' generators.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>UniformIntegerDist and UniformUnsignedDist now allow
you to set parameter minValue equal to maxValue. In this case that
value is returned every time.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>UniformDoubleDist also allows this, even if the set
[x,x) is mathematically suspect ...</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>NormalDist and LogNormalDist now allow you to specify
zero Variance, in which case the values returned are the Mean and
exp(Mean) respectively.</para></listitem> </itemizedlist> 

</para>
</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Changes since v. 0.6</title>

<para>
<itemizedlist> 

<listitem><para>The distribution classes have changed names to where
they all end in `Dist'. A simple search-and-replace in your code will
get you back up and running.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The strong distinction between `frozen' and
`un-frozen' distribution objects in v. 0.6 has been softened
considerably. You may now set and reset the default parameters as
often as you wish, and you may make calls for variates with given
parameters even if different default parameters have been
set.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The generation of uniform(0,1) floating point values
has been moved from the distribution objects into the generator
objects.  Thus, if all you need is a uniform(0,1) double, you have no
need of a distribution but can get what you desire from a
generator.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Note that the generators fill the mantissa of a double
from two 32-bit unsigned values in a different manner from v. 0.6
distributions, so output will be a bit different in the new
version.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>A bug in LogNormalDist has been
fixed.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The `getState:' method has been named `putStateInto:
(void *) buffer', and the `setState:' method is now `setStateFrom:
(void *) buffer. A quick search-and-replace fixes things in your
code.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>But note: these methods have also changed somewhat, as
has the size of the data being saved. As a result, v. 0.7
distributions will refuse to `setStateFrom' data saved by v. 0.6
objects.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>There should be fewer changes like this in the next
release.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

</formalpara>

<formalpara><title>Utility Objects Provided</title>

<para>The following objects have been defined in
<filename>random/random.m</filename>.  They may be accessed and used
from anywhere in your program.

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA[
id <SimpleRandomGenerator>   randomGenerator;
id <UniformIntegerDist>      uniformIntRand;
id <UniformUnsignedDist>     uniformUnsRand;
id <UniformDoubleDist>       uniformDblRand;
]]>
</programlisting>

The 3 distribution objects all draw their random numbers from the
MT19937 generator, which has a period of 2^19937 (10^6001) and is
quite fast.</para> </formalpara>
