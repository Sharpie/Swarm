C. USEFUL WEB SITES

Pierre L'Ecuyer maintains a personal web site at 
<http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lecuyer>. He has many of his own papers there, 
as well as further links. He has papers both on generating random numbers and
on testing random number generators.

George Marsaglia has a personal web site at <http://stat.fsu.edu/~geo>. His 
battery of tests for random generators, called Diehard, is not available there,
but rather from Hong Kong: <http://www.hku.hk/internet/randomCD.html>. A GUI 
version of Diehard has been under development for some time, but is not yet 
ready.

The pLab project in Salzburg, Austria: <http://random.mat.sbg.ac.at> also
has much useful information.
