1. The following changes have been made to the generators:

a) All the generators are now named XXXgen.

b) Generators that used to take 1 seed, but in actuality required many
more (i.e. ACG, SCG, SWB), used an LCG generator to create a full set
of seeds. This LCG has now been replaced by an inline PMMLCG,
which will make those generators produce output different from v. 0.6
from the same starting seed. Applies to ACG, SCG, SWB.

c) The SWB generators had a bug, in which the 'carry' was not handled 
correctly. This has been corrected. This changes output relative to
v. 0.6.

d) The SWB generators have had their 'runup' changed from 5*r values to r 
values, because that is the longest possible rho sequence. This changes 
output relative to v. 0.6.

e) The ACG and SCG generators, being full-cycle, do not need 'runup'
and this was eliminated. This changes output relative to v. 0.6.

f) The 'magic numbers' used by setState/getState to identify generators
have changed. The sizes of the records returned by getState have also
changed. Therefore version 0.7 generators will refuse to setState a 
generator based on version 0.6 data. 

g) The 'setState' method has been renamed to 'setStateFrom', 
and 'getState' to 'putStateInto'.

h) The -verifySelf methods have been exorcised. Their code has been 
moved to a separate test program. (See directory /testR0)

2. The following changes have been made to the distributions:

a) All the distribution objects are now named yyyDist (including the
Uniform ones).

b) In version 0.6, distributions generated their own uniform [0,1)
values internally after calling -getUnsignedSample from the attached
generator. The generators now supply uniform [0,1) doubles on their
own, and the distributions make use of this.

c) In version 0.6, distributions created doubles of 'full' precision
by using a bitfiddling trick borrowed from the GNU library to fill
the 53-bit mantissa of a double using two 32-bit random numbers. The
generators now use a different way of filling the double from two 
unsigneds, so output will not be exactly the same in version 0.7. 

d) LogNormalDist had a bug (a missing exp()), which has been fixed. This
changes output relative to version 0.6.

e) The 'magic numbers' used by setState/getState to identify distributions
have changed. The sizes of the records returned by getState have also
changed. Therefore version 0.7 distributions will refuse to setState a 
distribution based on version 0.6 data. 

f) The 'setState' method has been renamed to 'setStateFrom', 
and 'getState' to 'putStateInto'.

3. The following changes have been made to the random objects supplied
in simtools:

a) In version 0.6, the random generator supplied in simtools 
('randomGenerator') was initialized with a fixed seed value, which was 
the same always. In version 0.7, this is replaced by RANDOMSEED, which 
will be different from run to run. (This is deemed safer for naive or 
casual users.)

b) That generator was a 'short' one (PMMLCG1), with a period of
only 2^31-3. This is too short for users who use this as their only
generator. It has been replaced by MT19937, which has a longer period.
(A period of 2^19937 ~ 10^6001 should be enough for most swarm sims.)

The supplied distributions objects, uniformIntRand, uniformUnsRand and
uniformDblRand, are all connected to this random generator and draw 
their random numbers from it.
