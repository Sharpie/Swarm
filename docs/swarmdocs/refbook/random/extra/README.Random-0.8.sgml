<title>General Implementation Notes</title>

<para>This directory contains the code for version 0.80 of the random
number library for Swarm, supplied with Swarm version 1.4, and version
0.81 of the documentation.</para>

<para>Look at the <link linkend="SWARM.RANDOM.SGML.REFERENCE">Random
Library Reference</link> for the objects defined in this
library.</para>

<formalpara><title>`Fat' vs. `Thin' doubles</title>

<para>Note that distributions which use floating point variates from
their generators by default draw `fat' doubles (-getDoubleSample)
which use two calls to the basic unsigned sample method
(-getUnsignedSample). If you don't need this much precision, or want
to speed up the distributions, you can make the distributions use
`thin' samples (-getThinDoubleSample) instead. See the note at the top
of <filename>random/distributions.h</filename> for how to change this
behavior.</para>

<!--
<para>If Swarm has been installed properly, you need only say `make'
to recompile all the objects and then `make install' to place the new
library files in the installation directory. You can then do `make
clean' to get rid of all the .o files, which are not needed to run
Swarm.</para>
