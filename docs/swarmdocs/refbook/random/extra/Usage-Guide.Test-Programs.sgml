<listitem><para>In a separate <ulink
url="ftp://ftp.santafe.edu/pub/swarm/RandomTests-0.81.tgz">tar
file</ulink>, available at the SFI ftp site, there are a set of
programs which exercise aspects of the generator objects'
functionality.  The following (very utilitarian) programs are
available:

<itemizedlist>

    <listitem><formalpara><title>testR0</title><para>a program which
        exercises every generator and distribution, verifying correct
        operation and comparing output to that obtained on the
        author's system.</para></formalpara></listitem>

    <listitem><formalpara><title>testR1</title><para>a program which
    		prints out diagnostic output for code in
    		random.m.</para></formalpara></listitem>

    <listitem><formalpara><title>testR2</title><para>a program which
		asks each distribution and generator to describe
		itself using the Swarm xprint
		method.</para></formalpara></listitem>

    <listitem><formalpara><title>testR3</title><para>a program which
		asks each distribution and generator to describe
		itself using the objects' 'describe'
		method.</para></formalpara></listitem>

    <listitem><formalpara><title>testR4</title><para>a program that
		performs timing tests on each generator and
		distribution, computing the time it takes to call each
		object 10,000,000
		times.</para></formalpara></listitem>

    <listitem><formalpara><title>testR6</title><para>a program that
		generates a binary file containing 2.5M variates from
		a specified generator, for purposes of statistical
		testing (e.g. with ENT or Diehard.)</para></formalpara></listitem>

    <listitem><formalpara><title>testR7</title><para>a program which
		records, for each generator, the value of unsignedMax,
		the number of output bits, and the value of
		lengthOfSeedVector.</para></formalpara></listitem>

    <listitem><formalpara><title>testR9</title><para>a program which
		records, for each generator and distribution, the
		object's 'magic number' and the buffer size needed for
		getState/setState.</para></formalpara></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Statistical testing: the generators have been put
through the tests in the <filename>/testR6/ENT</filename> and
<filename>/testR6/Diehard</filename> directories. The raw data can be
found there.  The results are summarized in the test log files found
in the same test distribution. The distribution objects have not been
tested statistically yet.</para></listitem>

<PARA>The code here represents an effort to implement several
     efficient, reasonably safe generators. The algorithms come from
     reading the literature (<link
     linkend="SWARM.RANDOM.SGML.BIBLIOGRAPHY">Bibliography</link>).
     These algorithms have been implemented as accurately as possible
     and run through some simple tests. Some generators, included here
     for historical reasons only, are known to have bad statistical
     properties, and their use is deprecated. See <link
     linkend="swarm.random.sgml.appendix.sect1.adv-usage">Advanced
     Usage Guide</link>for information on the quality of the included
     generators.
</PARA>

<PARA>While the objects in this library are believed to function
  correctly, the prudent and paranoid modeller would do well testing
  them in some domain-specific way. One easy way to do this is to run
  an experiment twice: once with one class of generator (say, PMMLCG),
  and once with another (say, SWB). If the results differ radically,
  then you can suspect one of the generators. If they don't, well, the
  generators still might be faulty!</PARA>

<PARA>The generators supplied with this release have been subjected to
  statistical testing using George Marsaglia's
  <EMPHASIS>Diehard</EMPHASIS> tests as well as John Walker's entropy
  tests (ENT). The results of these tests are summarized in <link
  linkend="SWARM.RANDOM.SGML.APPENDIX.TABLE.GENERATOR.QUALITY">Generator
  quality table</link>. Other data on the properties of the generators
  are found there as well. These data support a discussion of how to
  choose one or more generators for your simulation.
</PARA>

<PARA>The ENT test is included in the tarball of test programs
  mentioned above. The Diehard tests are copyright and hence are not,
  but they can be downloaded from the web at:

<PARA>The distribution objects have not been statistically tested.</PARA>
