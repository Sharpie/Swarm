<title>A note on `simple' vs. `split' generators</title>

<para>Most of the generators supplied are of the 'simple'
variety. Think of these as supplying a single, long stream of
pseudorandom numbers. The description in the introduction of how to
obtain generator output assumed a simple generator. </para>

<para>There are also two generators, C2LCGXgen and C4LCGXgen, which
are of the `split' variety. Think of them as consisting of a number of
virtual generators, each supplying an independent stream of numbers
which we can divide up into a number of segments of a given length. To
obtain output from such a generator, we need to specify what virtual
generator to draw from:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
  myUnsigned = [mySplitGenerator getUnsignedSample: virtualgen];
]]>
</programlisting>

Read more about how to manage split generators below.</para>

</sidebar>

<para>I shall first discuss `simple' generators, and then discuss how
`split' generators differ from `simple' ones.  In the following text,
wherever I use <classname>PSWBgen</classname> as an example you may
substitute any other generator.</para>

<para>Note: any name that starts with <classname>my</classname> is
meant to designate a variable of the appropriate type which you have 
defined in your own
program.</para>

<para>Note: on defining variables that hold (pointers to) generators:
it is now a convention in the rest of Swarm that if you want to
specify what type of object a pointer should point to, you say:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
	id <protocolname> varname;
	varname = [classname create: aZone];
]]>
</programlisting>

instead of 

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
	classname *varname;
	varname = [classname create: aZone];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>Although it is usually the case that the <literal>protocolname =
the classname</literal>, in some cases it is not. And publishing the
protocols allows the programmers to keep unpublished what should
remain internal private class methods.</para>

<para>The generators are different from other Swarm objects, in that
they all perform the same function; they are drop-in replacements for
each other.  The 'split' generators (<classname>C2LCGXgen</classname>,
<classname>C4LCGXgen</classname>) all conform to the same protocol,
<classname>&lt;SplitRandomGenerator&gt;</classname>. The 'simple'
(non-split) generators all conform to the same protocol,
<classname>&lt;SimpleRandomGenerator&gt;</classname>.</para>

<para>Thus, when defining generators in your own program, you should say

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
	id <SimpleRandomGenerator> varname;
	varname = [classname create: aZone];
]]>
</programlisting>

(Though see below for the different create methods available.)</para>

<para>For backward compatibility, protocols
<classname>&lt;LCG1gen&gt;</classname>,
<classname>&lt;TT800gen&gt;</classname> etc. are still defined, <emphasis>but
their use is deprecated and they may disappear later.</emphasis></para>

<sect3>
<title>Simple generators</title>

<para>You create a generator in one of 3 ways:</para>

<sect4>
<title>the lazy way</title>

<para>
<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   id <SimpleRandomGenerator> myGenerator;
   myGenerator = [ PSWBgen createWithDefaults: [self getZone] ];
]]>
</programlisting>

This allocates the object and initializes it with STARTSEED, which
equals NEXTSEED if <option>--varyseed</option> was not specified, or
RANDOMSEED if it was. (These macros are defined in the file 
'randomdefs.h' in the source directory.)
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>using a single seed value</title>
<para>
<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   id <SimpleRandomGenerator> myGenerator;
   myGenerator = [ PSWBgen create: [self getZone] 
			setStateFromSeed: mySeed ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>This allocates the object and initializes it with your seed value. If the 
object actually requires a vector of seed values to fill the state, this 
method generates the rest of the values needed using an inline PMMLCG 
generator.</para>

<para>You can find out later what seed value was used to initialize
the generator:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myUnsigned = [ myGenerator getInitialSeed ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>And you can find out what the largest valid seed value is by
calling

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myUnsigned = [ myGenerator getMaxSeedValue ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>(In the current version of the library, the largest valid seed value
is 2^32-1 for all the generators. The seed may not be 0.) 
</para>

<para>You may reset the generator's state at any time using this
method:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   [ myGenerator setStateFromSeed: mySeedValue ];
]]>
</programlisting>

This will also reset to 0 the <literal>currentCount</literal> variable.</para>

<para>Alternatively, you may use the new -reset method [myGenerator
reset], which resets the generator its state at startup, or its state
at the point when -setStateFromSeed(s) was last used. Counters are
zeroed.</para> 
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>using a vector of seed values</title>

<para>Assume we have defined a fixed array at compile time: 

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
 unsigned  int mySeedVector [vectorLength];
]]>
</programlisting>

Then we can do this:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   id <SimpleRandomGenerator> myGenerator;
   myGenerator = [ PSWBgen create: [self getZone]
			setStateFromSeeds: mySeedVector ];
]]>
</programlisting>

You can find out how many seed values are required by asking

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myUnsigned = [ myGenerator lengthOfSeedVector ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>(Obviously, you must first successfully have created the object
to do this, for example using createWithDefaults! Or, see data in
<link
linkend="SWARM.RANDOM.SGML.APPENDIX.TABLE.GENERATOR.DATA">Generator
Data Table</link>)</para>

<para>And we allocate the seed vector dynamically this way:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   unsigned int *mySeedVector;
   mySeedVector = [[self getZone] alloc: [ myGenerator lengthOfSeedVector]];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>You can find out what vector of seed values was used to
initialize the object:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   unsigned int *myVector;
   myVector = [ myGenerator getInitialSeeds ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>And you can find out the largest seed values that are allowed
for the particular generator:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   unsigned int *myVectorToo;
   myVectorToo = [ myGenerator getMaxSeedValues ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>(These values vary from generator to generator, and they may not
be the same for all elements of the vector for a given
generator. Valid seeds never take the value 0.)</para>

<para>NOTE: in the above two calls, the variable myVector is set to
point to an array internal to the generator. If you want to preserve
the array's values outside the generator, you need to allocate space
in your program either statically or dynamically, and use a for-loop
to copy data from myVector[i] to myAllocatedVector[i].</para>

<para>You may reset the generator's state at any time by using the
method

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   [ myGenerator setStateFromSeeds: (unsigned *) mySeedVector ];
]]>
</programlisting>

This will also reset to 0 the currentCount variable.</para>

<para>NOTE: if you set a generator's state from a vector of seeds, the
call:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myUnsignedValue = [ myGenerator getInitialSeed ];
]]>
</programlisting>

will return a value of 0 (an invalid seed). On the other hand, if you
initialize the generator with a single seed value, the call

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   mySeedVector = [ myGenerator getInitialSeeds ];
]]>
</programlisting>

will return the seed vector that would produce identical output to what
you obtained using the single seed.</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>

<title>antithetic values</title>

<para>You can make the generator serve up antithetic values by
setting:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   [ myGenerator setAntithetic: YES ];
]]>
</programlisting>

If thus set, this makes -getUnsignedSample return (unsignedMax-x) instead
of x, and the floating point methods return (1.0 - y) instead of y. The 
default for this parameter is that it is not set.</para>

<para>You can ascertain if this flag is set by calling

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myBooleanValue = [ myGenerator getAntithetic ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
</sect4>

<sect4>
<title>generator output</title>

<para>You obtain successive pseudorandom numbers from a generator by calling:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myUnsignedValue = [ myGenerator getUnsignedSample ];
]]>
</programlisting>

The largest value that may be returned can be found by asking

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myUnsignedValue = [ myGenerator getUnsignedMax ];
]]>
</programlisting>

(The smallest value returned is always 0.)</para>

<para>If you would rather have floating point output in the range
[0.0,1.0), you call one of these:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Using 1 unsigned value to fill the mantissa:
   myFloatValue  = [ myGenerator getFloatSample ];
   myDoubleValue = [ myGenerator getThinDoubleSample ];
]]>
</programlisting>

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Using 2 unsigned values to fill the mantissa:
   myDoubleValue     = [ myGenerator getDoubleSample ];
   myLongDoubleValue = [ myGenerator getLongDoubleSample ];
]]>
</programlisting>

NOTE that the last method is not portable, because the size of a long double
varies and hence the precision varies between architectures.</para>

<para>Finally, you can obtain a count of how many variates have been
generated:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myLongLongInt = [ myGenerator getCurrentCount ];
]]>
</programlisting>

(currentCount is an unsigned long long int, which counts up to 2^64.)</para>
</sect4>
</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Split generators</title>

<para>A split generator is a generator for which we are able to split the
output stream into arbitrary non-overlapping segments, which we can 
access directly and easily. Such segments are statistically independent
streams of (pseudo)random numbers.</para>

<para>We configure a split generator as consisting of a number (A) of
"virtual generators", each of which has access to a number (2^v) of
segments of length 2^w. The parameters A,v,w are specified when the
generator is created. For example, for the C4LCGXgen generator, the
default creation values are A=128, v=31, w=41. The only limitation is
that A*(2^v)*(2^w) must not exceed the generator's cycle length, which
is 2^60 for C2LCGXgen and 2^120 for C4LCGXgen.</para>

<para>We specify the configuration (A,v,w) at create time this way:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   id <SplitRandomGenerator> myGenerator;
   myGenerator = [ C4LCGXgen create: [self getZone]
			setA: 64 setv: 20 setw: 76 
			setStateFromSeed: mySeedValue ];
]]>
</programlisting>

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   id <SplitRandomGenerator> myGenerator;
   myGenerator = [ C4LCGXgen create: [self getZone]
			setA: 32 setv: 25 setw: 60
			setStateFromSeeds: (unsigned *) mySeedVector ];
]]>
</programlisting>

(In both cases, the only limitation is that A * 2^v * 2^w must be less
than the generator's period, 2^60 for C2LCGX and 2^120 for
C4LCGX.)</para>

<para>For obtaining output, we need to specify which of the A
'virtual' generators we want to draw from:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myUnsignedValue   = [ myGenerator getUnsignedSample: 12 ];
   myFloatValue      = [ myGenerator getFloatSample: myVirtualGenerator ];
   myDoubleValue     = [ myGenerator getThinDoubleSample: someUnsignedValue ];
   myDoubleValue     = [ myGenerator getDoubleSample: 32 ];
   myLongDoubleValue = [ myGenerator getLongDoubleSample: 0 ];
]]>
</programlisting>

Virtual generators are numbered from 0 to (A-1).</para>

<para>Obtaining the current count of variates generated likewise:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   myLongLongInt = [ myGenerator getCurrentCount:   myVirtualGenerator ];
   myLongLongInt = [ myGenerator getCurrentSegment: myVirtualGenerator ];
]]>
</programlisting>

The latter call indicates what segment number the specified virtual
generator is currently drawing numbers from.</para>

<para>Other than these methods, the methods discussed above
under 'simple' generators are the same for 'split' generators.</para>

<para>In *addition* to this, 'split' generators have the following
methods to manage the virtual generators:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Place all virtual generators at the start of the first segment:
   [ myGenerator initAll ];	// done automatically at creation
]]>
</programlisting>

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Place all virtual generators back to the start of the current segment:
   [ myGenerator restartAll ];
]]>
</programlisting>

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Place all virtual generators at the start of the next segment:
   [ myGenerator advanceAll ];
]]>
</programlisting>

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Place all virtual generators at the start of the indicated segment:
   [ myGenerator jumpAllToSegment: myLongLongIntValue ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>You may also address individual virtual generators:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   [ myGenerator initGenerator:    myVgen ];
   [ myGenerator restartGenerator: myVgen ];
   [ myGenerator advanceGenerator: myVgen ];
   [ myGenerator jumpGenerator:    myVgen    toSegment: myLongLongIntValue ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>InternalState methods common to simple and split generators:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Print (most of) the object's state data to a stream:
   [ myNormalDist describe: myStream ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>The stream myStream may be created thus:
<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
id myStream = [ OutStream create: [self getZone] setFileStream: stdout ]; or
id myStream = [ OutStream create: [self getZone] setFileStream: stderr ];

   // Get the (class) name of the object:
   myString = [ myNormalDist getName ];

   // Get the object's 'magic number', used by putStateInto / setStateFrom:
   myUnsigned = [ myNormalDist getMagic ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

</sect3>

<sect3>
<title>Saving and Resetting State</title>

<para>You may save, and later restore, the internal state of a
generator using these methods:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Get the size of the memory buffer needed by putStateInto / setStateFrom:
   myUnsigned = [ myGenerator getStateSize ];

   // Extract the generator's state data into your memory buffer:
   [ myGenerator putStateInto: myBuffer ];

   // Set the generator's state from data in a memory buffer:
   [ myGenerator setStateFrom: myBuffer ];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>To illustrate, assume the following data definitions:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   FILE * myFile;
   const char * myFileName = "MyGenFile.bin"; // or whatever
   int stateSizeG;
   id stateBufG;
   int status;
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>The following code shows how to save an object's state to disk:
(You should add your own code to deal with disk file errors, either
aborting or printing out error messages.)

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Ask how big a buffer we need:
   stateSizeG = [ myGenerator getStateSize ];

   // Allocate memory for the buffer:
   stateBufG  = [[self getZone] alloc: stateSizeG];

   // Ask the generator to put state data into the buffer:
   [ myGenerator putStateInto: (void *) stateBufG ];

   // Open a disk file for output:
   myFile = fopen(myFileName, "w");
   if (myFile == NULL) { };	// error on open: disk full, or no permissions

   // Write the state buffer to disk in binary form:
   status = fwrite(stateBufG, stateSizeG, 1, myFile);
   if (status < 1) { };		// error on write: disk full?

   // Close the file
   status = fclose(myFile);
   if (status) { };		// error on close ?

   // Free the memory allocated to the buffer:
   [[self getZone] free: stateBufG];

   // Or, for test purposes, just zero the buffer data instead:
   // memset(stateBufG, 0, stateSizeG);
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>

<para>This code shows how to set an object's state from a disk file:

<programlisting>
<![ CDATA [
   // Ask how big a buffer we need:
   stateSizeG = [ myGenerator getStateSize ];

   // Allocate memory for the buffer:
   stateBufG  = [[self getZone] alloc: stateSizeG];

   // Open a disk file for input:
   myFile = fopen(myFileName, "r");
   if (myFile == NULL) { };	// error on open: file not found

   // Read state data into the memory buffer:
   status = fread(stateBufG, stateSizeG, 1, myFile);
   if (status < 1) { };		// error on read

   // Close the file:
   status = fclose(myFile);
   if (status) { };		// error on close

   // Ask the generator set its state from the buffer data:
   [ myGenerator setStateFrom: (void *) stateBufG ];

   // Free the memory allocated to the buffer:
   [[self getZone] free: stateBufG];
]]>
</programlisting>
</para>
</sect3>
