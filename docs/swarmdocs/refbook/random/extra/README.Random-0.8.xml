<title>General Implementation Notes</title>

<para>This is release 1.4.1 of the Swarm libraries. It contains version
0.8 of the random-number library and version 0.81 of the random library
documentation. </para>

<para>Look at the <link linkend="SWARM.RANDOM.SGML.REFERENCE">Random
Library Reference</link> for the objects defined in this

<formalpara><title>`Fat' vs. `Thin' doubles</title>

<para>Note that distributions which use floating point variates from
their generators by default draw `fat' doubles (-getDoubleSample)
which use two calls to the basic (32-bit) unsigned int sample method
(-getUnsignedSample) in order to fill the 53-bit mantissa of a double.
If you don't need this much precision, or want to speed up the
distributions, you can make the distributions use `thin' samples
(-getThinDoubleSample) instead. See the note at the top of
<filename>random/distributions.h</filename> for how to change this
behavior. If you do, be sure to remake Swarm
(<userinput>make</userinput>, <userinput>make install</userinput>).
