  <sidebar>    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>The object types of the collections library establish a
      general-purpose foundation to maintain object references or
      other values as members of structured collections.
      Customization options consolidate a wide range of basic
      collection structures into a few core types (Array, List, Set,
      Map).  These types are defined strictly by their interface, not
      their internal implementation.  Specialized options, however,
      give control and flexibility for efficient, low-level use (such
      as implementing other libraries).</para>

    <para>The collections library follows the <link linkend="SWARM.LIBRARY.SGML.APPENDIX">library interface
      conventions</link> of the <link linkend="SWARM.DEFOBJ.SGML.REFERENCE">defobj library</link>.  It also
      depends on standard supertypes and classes defined by this
      library.  Initialization of the collections library
      automatically initializes the defobj library as well.  Since
      defobj also requires the collections library, both must always
      be linked into an application together.</para>

      library usage.  If you can't find an example there that
      exercises a message or option that you want to use, chances are
      it's not implemented.</para>

  <sect1 xreflabel="Collections Subclassing Reference" id="SWARM.COLLECTIONS.SGML.SECT1.SUBCLASS">        <title>Subclassing Reference</title>

    <para>Until the collections library has been fully implemented,
      subclassing conventions from collections implementation classes
      are still in flux.  In general, these classes will be among the
      most complex uses of multiple classes selected to implement an
      independent object type. (See <link linkend="SWARM.LIBRARY.SGML.APPENDIX">library definition
      conventions</link> for a summary of the distinction between
      types and classes.)  New methods are being developed to simplify
      subclassing from such implementations.  In the meantime, if you
      need to use to a collection within the implementation of your
      own class, just put an instance variable in your class and put
      the collection in that, and pass through the messages of the
      collection you want to have available on your class to this
      variable.  In many if not most cases, this is better design
      anyway, because you control all use of the underlying
      structure.</para>

    <para>A collections library is one of the most important
      foundation services for object-oriented programming.  Most
      object-oriented systems provide at least the start of a
      general-purpose collections library.  The GNUSTEP, project, for
      example, provides the libobject library (currently in alpha test
      at <ulink url="ftp://alpha.prep.ai.mit.edu/"></ulink>) which
      includes a collections library along with other services
      intended to parallel those of the OpenStep framework developed
      by Next.</para>

    <para>Swarm has implemented its own collection library to meet the
      specialized needs of its agent simulation framework.  </para>
