      <TITLE>Overview</TITLE>

      <PARA>Swarm is a collection of libraries against which you link
        your simulation code. This document describes the interface
        for those core libraries.

      <important>
        <para>The probe, random and technical appendices formerly part
          of the <citetitle>Reference Guide for Swarm</citetitle> have
          been removed and relocated to the new &userbook;.  In the
          interests of conserving paper, the grid turtle example
          programs are available in <filename>tar.gz</filename> format
          from the Swarm ftp site (see <xref
          linkend="swarm.grid.sgml.appendix">) and pointers to the
          full text of the LGPL and GPL licenses (see <xref
          linkend="swarm.license.sgml.appendix">) are provided rather
          than the full text itself.
