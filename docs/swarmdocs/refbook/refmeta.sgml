      <TITLE>Overview</TITLE>

      <PARA>Swarm is essentially a collection of libraries against
        which you link your simulation code. This document describes the
        complete interface references for those core libraries which
        are crucial to the proper execution of Swarm, and are
        therefore shipped with the Swarm distribution.</PARA>
