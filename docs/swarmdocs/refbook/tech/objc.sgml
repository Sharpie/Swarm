  <PARA>The main technical skill required of a Swarm user is the
    ability to write Objective C code. Other recommended skills
    include the ability to use tools such as gdb and emacs. For the
    record, if you know C and have some form of experience in either
    C++ or Smalltalk, then learning Objective C should take no more
    than a day or so.</PARA>
