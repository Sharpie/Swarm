    <PARA>The activity library is in process of being converted to draw even
      more of its support from underlying types and classes in the defobj
      and collections libraries.  The basic interface has already been
      changed to reflect this consolidation, so the progrmming interface
      for currently available function is expected to remain stable.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>The activity library follows the documentation structure of
      the Swarm <LINK LINKEND="SWARM.DEFOBJ.SGML.REFERENCE">library
      interface conventions</LINK>.  There are placeholders for each
      section of documentation so that all links should at least link
      up with something, whether or not there's anything there.  The
      Interface Reference section is already fairly complete, and
      there is a start toward a more complete Usage Guide section.
      The Advanced Usage Guide and other sections will come at a later
      time.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
      An attempt has been made to remove all discussion of future
      capabilities and to document instead only the capability that is
      already there.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>Source for code examples in the Usage Guide is included in the
      text where it occurs.  Source consists of fragments taken from example
      programs.  The example programs themselves may be downloaded from the
      web pages and compiled on your own system, using links provided for that
      purpose.  (.. currently there are no code examples in the Usage Guide,
      which so far is only a general overview of the activity library ..)
    </PARA>

    <PARA>There is also a directory of test programs (<LINK
        LINKEND="SWARM.GRID.SGML.APPENDIX">GridTurtle test
        programs</LINK>, contained within the documentation release
        directory) that provides additional code examples of many
        basic features of the defobj, collections, and activity
        libraries.  These code examples are very rough and subject to
        change, however, since their main use is with each new release
        of the libraries to test various new or existing features.
        They are sometimes the only source, however, for examples of
        some library features that have not yet been used anywhere
        else.
