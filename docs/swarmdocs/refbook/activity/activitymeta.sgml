    <PARA>The activity library is in process of being converted to draw even
      more of its support from underlying types and classes in the defobj
      and collections libraries.  The basic interface has already been
      changed to reflect this consolidation, so the programming interface
      for currently available function is expected to remain stable.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>The activity library follows the documentation structure of
      the Swarm <link linkend="defobj.ref">library interface
      conventions</link>.  There are placeholders for each section of
      documentation so that all links should at least link up with
      something, whether or not there's anything there.  The Interface
      Reference section is already fairly complete, and there is a
      start toward a more complete Usage Guide section.  The Advanced
      Usage Guide and other sections will come at a later time.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
      An attempt has been made to remove all discussion of future
      capabilities and to document instead only the capability that is
      already there.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>Source for code examples in the Usage Guide is included in the
      text where it occurs.  Source consists of fragments taken from example
      programs.  The example programs themselves may be downloaded from the
      web pages and compiled on your own system, using links provided for that
      purpose.  (.. currently there are no code examples in the Usage Guide,
      which so far is only a general overview of the activity library ..)
    </PARA>

    <PARA>There is also a directory of test programs (<link
        linkend="grid.ref">GridTurtle test programs</link>, contained
        within the documentation release directory) that provides
        additional code examples of many basic features of the defobj,
        collections, and activity libraries.  These code examples are
        very rough and subject to change, however, since their main
        use is with each new release of the libraries to test various
        new or existing features.  They are sometimes the only source,
        however, for examples of some library features that have not
        yet been used anywhere else.
