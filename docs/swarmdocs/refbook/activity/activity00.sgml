    <PARA>The activity library is responsible for scheduling actions
      to occur within a simulated world, and for making these actions
      actually happen at the right time in the right order.  It
      provides the foundation of dynamic, object-oriented simulation
      within Swarm.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>Actions consist of messages to objects, calls to functions,
      or groups of actions in some defined order.  The activity
      library guarantees that all these actions, and the state changes
      they produce, occur at predictable points in time.  Time is
      defined by the relative order of actions, and may also be
      indexed by the discrete values of a world clock.

      <TITLE>Role of the activity library in Swarm</TITLE>

      <PARA> The activity library provides a foundation for dynamic,
        object-oriented simulation in Swarm.  Swarm assumes that a user
        defines an object-oriented representation for the structure of a world
        to be simulated.  Once such a representation is established, activity
        library components are responsible for generating all state changes
        and flow of information within it.  These state changes must be
        carefully controlled to ensure that they occur only at appropriate
        times and places in the model.  The activity library provides
        mechanisms to establish this control.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Once the simulation of a dynamic model begins, everything
        that happens to the model occurs as a direct result of
        messages sent to world objects by activity library components.
        These components are also represented by objects, since this
        is the most effective means for their representation as well,
        but their purpose is not to represent the current state of the
        simulated world, but rather to generate changes in world
        objects by sending messages in a valid order.  The activity
        library has two basic categories of components: those that
        represent messages to be sent, including constraints on
        permissible order for sending them, and those that execute the
        message sends these representations specify, making sure they
        conform with all constraints.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>All changes to a model occur as a result of messages sent
        to objects within it.  These messages invoke compiled methods
        of receiving objects, which may change local state or send
        messages to other objects to propagate effects as widely as
        needed.  Only top-level function calls or message sends that
        initiate model processing are the concern of the activity
        library.  Because the activity library finally interacts with
        the world model just by invoking its defined methods, the
        model can prepackage as much behavior as it can in the form of
        fast compiled methods.  The activity library just triggers the
        prepackaged behavior at proper times under its own explicit,
        dynamically interpreted representation.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>As conditions shift during execution of a model, the model can also
        examine and alter the representation of its future behavior contained in
        the activity structures that drive it.  Any changes to this future
        behavior, however, still occur only as a result of some currently
        executing action initiated by the activity library.

      <TITLE>Activity library components</TITLE>
      
      <PARA>The activity library defines one set of basic object types
        to provide a very rich representation of the kinds of message
        sending patterns it could generate.  Its other major category
        of object types controls and tracks a current state of
        processing within these representations.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Both these representations are more abstract than typical
        object representations, since they deal not with any constant
        state which can be statically analyzed, but with shifting
        patterns of messages to be fired to generate such state.
        While the basic structure of a Swarm simulation is that of a
        discrete event simulation, its activity representation is also
        more complicated than most such systems.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>There are two basic reasons for the potential complexity
        of a Swarm activity representation.  One is that Swarm
        supports a decentralized representation of activity to be
        generated, both to reflect the nature of much of the behavior
        that it simulates, and so that execution may be distributed
        across multiple parallel processors.  To avoid any need for
        synchronizing its decoupled activities more often than
        necessary, Swarm enables a model designer to avoid
        overspecifying constraints on the patterns of message sends
        which might potentially be valid.  The partial order
        representation it adopts for a distributed and decoupled plan
        of activity is inherently more complicated than the single
        centralized event list adopted by many discrete event
        simulation systems.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>The other reason for potential added complexity is that
        Swarm's representation of intended activity may be broken into
        many separate, modular components, which can be bound together
        in various ways to create larger components.  The Swarm
        composition structure, when fully implemented, will be
        fundamentally as powerful as the modular abstractions found in
        most programming languages, with the added complexity of
        controlling the time at which various events occur.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>In spite of this high potential complexity, none of these
        features is needed for many simple models, such as those that
        contain only a small variety of basic behaviors, or which
        define all their behavior to occur at regular, repeating
        timesteps.  The Swarm representation is extremely rich to
        enable it to scale to large, multi-level models with a variety
        of dependent behaviors built into the model, and also to
        facilitate running models on massively parallel machines.
        Many of the features which seem complex, moreover, are also
        especially well-suited to building modular and reusable
        library components.  It is anticipated that many of the more
        advanced features will find their heaviest usage in pre-built
        libraries that hide internal complexity from applications that
        use them.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>No matter how complex the structures built from them, all
        the activity library components finally result in the direct
        execution of messages sends to objects in a model.  Because of
        this direct execution, very precise meaning can be defined for
        each of them, in terms of message sends that can or must
        occur.  Every component of a structure to be executed, and
        every event of its execution, can also be accessed using the
        interfaces of an object-oriented representation.  This means
        that tools can be built to understand and interact with any
        components to be executed, and also to trace and debug
        activity as it occurs.  None of these tools have been built
        yet as part of Swarm, but many of the activity library
        interfaces are present to support them, not because normal use
        of the library requires the added components.
      </PARA>
    </SECT2>

    <SECT2>
      <TITLE>Action plan components</TITLE>

      <PARA>The first set of activity library components represent messages to
        be sent to objects in a model, together with constraints in the order
        in which they may be sent.  All these components are defined as
        subtypes of the one generic type called ActionPlan.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>The two basic kinds of action plans are a simple group of
        actions to be performed in some order, called an ActionGroup,
        and a series of actions to be performed at discrete points in
        time, called a Schedule.  The basic element of an action plan
        is a simple object called an Action.  An action defines a
        particular message to be sent to an object or objects.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>In its representation of action plans, Swarm relies
        heavily on the dynamic message sending capabilities of the
        Objective C language.  The support of Objective C for dynamic
        message sends is absolutely crucial to Swarm's implementation
        of generic activity structures.  Objective C defines a special
        kind of data value called a selector, which identifies a
        message according to its name.  One of these selector values
        is stored in each action of an action plan.  During execution
        of the plan, Objective C machinery performs the actual message
        send using its selector.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Action plans are free-standing objects that may be created
        directly by a user program, using a variety of selectable
        create-time options.  Once created, action plans may also
        refer to each other, by containing special kinds of actions to
        start another action plan or to perform all the actions within
        it.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Individual actions can be created only as completely
        controlled components of some action plan.  They are created
        not by a standard create message, but by special messages
        (each containing the phrase createAction in its name) sent to
        an action plan that creates the action as part of the action
        plan.  If the same action is needed in more than one plan, it
        has to be created in each plan where it is needed.  If the
        entire action plan is dropped, all its actions are also
        automatically dropped.  So the only action plan components
        which need to be directly managed by an application are the
        action plans themselves.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Action plans are relatively straightforward components,
        because they are entirely passive.  The only actions they ever contain
        are those which an application has created in them.  These actions
        stay in them indefinitely unless a special option is requested to
        clean them out as each one is executed.  Because these plans are
        passive, read-only components to all execution machinery, if the same
        pattern of actions needs to be triggered at multiple points in a
        model, it's perfectly valid to create one copy of the actions in an
        action plan, and then refer to the plan anywhere the actions may be
        needed.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Even though action plans are passive, containing only what
        has been placed in them, there is no requirement that their contents
        remain fixed.  Both of the action groups and schedules are implemented
        directly as collections of their actions.  New actions may be added at
        any time, and existing ones may be dropped or moved from position to
        another.  The contents of action plans may be as dynamic as they need
        to be to represent the future actions needed in a model.  None of
        these shifting contents has any effect on the model until actually
        processed during model execution.
      </PARA>

    </SECT2>

    <SECT2>
      <TITLE>Model execution component</TITLE>

      <PARA> The main responsibility of model execution is just to
        perform the actions specified by an action plan, in an order
        of execution consistent with any requirements of the plan.
        Each action plan may specify as few or as many constraints as
        it likes over the possible order in which its actions could be
        performed.  Given these specifications, the execution objects
        are entirely responsible for selecting each action to be
        performed and then performing them.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>There are two simple cases of ordering that account for
        most all usage, including that of the current Swarm demo
        programs.  One is to permit the actions to be performed in any
        order, including concurrent execution if hardware and software
        support were available to do this.  The other is to require
        them to be performed in some specific sequence, one after
        another, so that the effects of one action could depend on
        actions which preceded it.  This sequence could be either
        fixed and predetermined, or dynamically established each time
        the action plan is performed.  If a dynamically determined
        sequence is needed, perhaps even selecting which actions are
        to be performed at all, users can provide custom subclasses
        for an action plan and an execution object that performs it.
        A builtin option is to generate an entirely random sequence
        each time a plan is executed.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Each time an action plan is being processed, a special
        kind of object called an activity is created entirely
        automatically by the runtime processing machinery.  These
        activity objects implement the internal machinery of a virtual
        processor which has the ability to execute action plans.  To
        get any activity started on a model, a processor is first
        initialized to run a single top-level plan.  All other
        activity during the lifetime of a model must occur as a result
        of actions initiated by this plan (which may include the
        startup of other plans).
      </PARA>

      <PARA>Because the activity objects are internal to the
        processing machinery, an application can usually just ignore
        their existence.  They come and go dynamically as various
        action plans are started and completed, all arranged in a
        stack or tree of current activities controlled by a single
        top-level processor.  The activity objects are potentially
        useful, however, to obtain information about the context in
        which an action is currently running, or to build debugging or
        tracing tools to understand actions being performed.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>One of the kinds of context information available from an
        activity object is the current time of a clock value
        incremented as a schedule is processed.  A schedule is a kind
        of action plan in which all actions occur at specific points
        in time explicitly established within the schedule.  As a
        schedule is executed, the activity object keeps a current time
        clock, which holds a global time from the start of all model
        execution, regardless of the time when the schedule itself was
        started.  An activity object that processes a schedule is
        called a timeline activity, because its time continually
        increases from a global base time regardless of times
        contained in the schedule.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>New activities are created whenever an action plan being
        processed contains an action to perform another action plan,
        or to start another action plan for autonomous execution.  If
        one action plan performs another, its own processing is
        stopped until a new activity processing the other action plan
        completes.  If one action plan starts another, the new action
        plan is started as an autonomous activity controlled only by a
        higher-level, containing activity.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>A Swarm is an activity that exists only to control and
        coordinate other started subactivities.  Unless the
        subactivities have some special form of explicit
        synchronization, none of their internal actions has any
        required ordering relative to those of other plans except as
        explicitly established during activity execution.  The swarm
        can serve as a simple container of started subactivities which
        only occasionally synchronize for messages they send to each
        other.  The swarm can be used to hold collections of objects
        as well as its subactivities as needed to help them coordinate
        with one another.
      </PARA>

      <PARA>One special form of synchronization within a swarm is
        built into the virtual processing machinery.  This
        synchronization interleaves the actions that occur for every
        successive time value during processing of timeline
        subactivities.  This merging of actions is often relied on to
        interleave display and analysis processing with the scheduled
        actions of a base model.  Since no other mechanisms for
        subactivity coordination are implemented in the current
        version of Swarm, synchronizing subschedule activities is the
        major current role of the Swarm activity type.  In later
        versions of Swarm, a swarm will also serve as an important
        means for organizing a large models into clusters of more
        densely interacting components, and will also provide a basis
        of decomposition for parallel execution.  </PARA>
