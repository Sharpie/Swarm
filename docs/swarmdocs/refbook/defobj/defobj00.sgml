      <TITLE>Why Swarm uses Objective C</TITLE>

      <PARA>Swarm uses object-oriented programming not only because this is a good
        way to build general-purpose software libraries, but because the very
        concept of an object is at the base of how you build a model in
        Swarm. To build a simulation in Swarm, the first step to define the
        various kinds of objects that can inhabit some real or artificial
        world, and the second step is to define the kinds of events that can
        occur to these objects, including all the different ways that the
        objects can interact with each other.</PARA>

      <PARA>The basic concept of an object is that it responds to external events,
        and that the only thing that really matters about an object are the
        ways it can be observed responding to these events. In an
        object-oriented programming system, an object is represented by some
        uniquely identified chunk of data, and the events are the dynamic
        operations that can be made to occur on these objects.</PARA>

      <PARA>Different object-oriented programming systems define the operations
        that occur on objects in different ways. For example, in C++ the
        operations are called "member functions" and look much like an
        ordinary function call in the C language. In Objective C, an operation
        on an object is called a "message" and has a special syntax by which
        you call it, but a message also has arguments and behaves in many
        respects like a call to a function.</PARA>

      <PARA>The key requirement for Swarm is to be able to make all these
        operations happen to any object at any time, whenever they're supposed
        to occur within some simulated world. It stores these operations
        inside its own data structures, and when you run a simulation in
        Swarm, the Swarm system itself traverses these data structures to make
        the necessary operations happen at the proper time.</PARA>

      <PARA>Swarm needs to be able to make any kind of action happen to any kind
        of object at any time, and to do this it needs very general-purpose
        structures that hold some kind of representation of the actions
        themselves. That's a special requirement that not every object
        language provides. You already have enough work to define the kinds of
        objects that can exist inside your model, and Swarm doesn't want you
        to have to define an even larger number of objects for every kind of
        event that might occur to your objects. Instead, it wants the object
        language to provide it with a representation of the operations on
        objects that you've already defined. Swarm can then store these
        representations in its own data structures, and make the operations
        happen whenever it needs to.</PARA>

      <PARA>In Swarm, the representation of events that happen on objects
        are just as fundamental to the model as the objects themselves. That's
        why Swarm is a "discrete-event" simulation system. But if the object
        system doesn't provide a general-purpose enough representation of
        events as well as objects, there would be a lot more work to do. The
        Objective C system, through its special data type called a "message
        selector," provides a representation of operations that is flexible
        enough to do this, but the C++ language does not. (In C++, the
        compiler requires more information about an operation than the event
        structures in Swarm would be able to provide.)</PARA>

      <PARA>There's a host of additional reasons why Objective C has also
        been a good match for the requirements of the Swarm system. Like C++,
        the operations on objects can be compiled to a very efficient form
        (though Objective C does require a little more overhead than C++ to
        get the operation started). This efficiency can be very important for
        a simulation, since simulations can run for very long periods of time
        to explore all the behavior that might occur within their simulated
        worlds. Other languages, such as Lisp, Smalltalk, and Java, also have
        the "dynamic message dispatch" feature that would make general-purpose
        event structures possible, but they still carry significant added
        overhead compared to C.</PARA>

      <PARA>Objective C is also a very simple extension to the C
        language. Basic knowledge of C is already widespread, and a few days
        are typically all that is needed to learn the few additions of
        Objective C. (Really learning the concepts of objects, however, can
        take much longer, no matter what object language you try to use.)</PARA>

      <PARA>Objective C was also a good choice for Swarm because it has a
        high quality, freely distributable implementation in the GNU C
        compiler. One of the main concerns about Objective C is that it isn't
        nearly as widely known or used as other languages like C++, but at
        least the GNU C compiler assures it will be available on machines
        where Swarm needs to run. The OpenStep system now part of the Apple
        Rhapsody project (formerly NeXTStep of the NeXT corporation), and the
        parallel GNUStep project, also help assure that Objective C is a
        living language.</PARA>

      <PARA>There are even more powerful aspects of Objective C that Swarm
        takes advantage of. Some of these are described in the <LINK LINKEND="DEFOBJ.ADVUSAGE">Advanced Usage Guide</LINK> of the defobj
        library. But many others are at the heart of how Swarm uses Objective
        C, and so are dealt with in the rest of this Usage Guide. The entire
        purpose of the defobj library is to define a standard style for the
        use of Objective C in Swarm. This style is backed up by a library of
        foundation classes that Swarm provides to support this style.</PARA><PARA></PARA>

      <PARA>Swarm provides its own foundation classes even for such basic
        operations as creating an object, and other support that user classes
        ordinarily receive from a builtin Object superclass. A good
        understanding of the defobj library is essential for Objective C
        programming in Swarm. Like any programming language, Objective C
        requires learning not only the rules of the language itself, but also
        a standard library of initial capabilities that you build
        from. Objective C doesn't really have a single official standard
        library (or language definition either, for that matter), but the
        OpenStep foundation libraries (and the OpenStep language definition)
        come very close to this status.</PARA>

      <PARA>For a variety of reasons explained here and in the <LINK LINKEND="DEFOBJ.ADVUSAGE">Advanced Usage Guide</LINK>, Swarm doesn't
        use a standard library based on the NextStep foundation interface. You
        can still learn the Objective C language from other available sources,
        but you have to be careful to sort out the language level from the
        standard object and library support they also discuss.</PARA>

      <PARA>The index page of the Swarm documentation provides a variety of
        links to other Objective C resources.  In particular, it provides a
        link to a complete on-line reference for the Objective C language as
        defined by OpenStep (formerly NextStep) and implemented by the GNU C
        compiler. None of the Swarm documentation attempts to duplicate this
        coverage of the basic language; Swarm assumes that you learn Objective
        C from other available sources. The Objective C reference (<ULINK URL="http://devworld.apple.com/techpubs/rhapsody/ObjectiveC/index.html">Object-Oriented
          Programming and the Objective C Language</ULINK>) is the single best
        available source, and it can also be ordered as a hardcopy book from
        the <ULINK URL="http://devworld.apple.com/techpubs/rhapsody/rhapsody.html">Rhapsody
          Developer Documentation site</ULINK> . Don't try to program in
        Objective C without it.</PARA><PARA></PARA>

      <TITLE>Swarm style of Objective C Programming</TITLE> 

      <PARA>No matter where you've learned to program in Objective C, don't
        try to use Objective C in Swarm without understanding the special ways
        in which Swarm adapts its use of the language and the language runtime
        system. Your place to find this information is right here in the
        defobj library. Defobj not only provides the most basic layer of
        foundation class libraries for Swarm, but also serves as the place
        where all the rules and guidelines for the use of Objective C in Swarm
        are gathered together.</PARA>

      <PARA>Some of these rules and guidelines don't even require any
        specific software to implement them, but are just conventions and
        recommended style that anyone programming in Objective C can follow
        when their goals are similar to those of Swarm, and to a large extent
        often do. These kinds of conventions are the focus of this section;
        following sections discuss aspects of Swarm Objective C style that
        depend on specific software support.</PARA>

      <PARA>More to come... For now, see <LINK LINKEND="LIBRARY.APP">Library
          Interface Conventions</LINK> for some of this information, and Swarm
        tutorials for much of the rest.</PARA>

    <PARA>The defobj library currently includes the CreateDrop and
      Object_s superclasses used by other libraries. For user objects in
      Swarm simulations the SwarmObject superclass in the objectbase library
      packages all required behavior of these superclasses into a single,
      simpler superclass.</PARA>

    <PARA>The defobj library also provides support for custom-generated classes,
      such as those which implement separate phases of the standard create
      protocol. (See generated phase classes in the Advanced Usage Guide.)
      Subclassing from custom-generated classes is still not officially
      supported, because the framework for custom class generation is still
      being finalized. Custom-generated classes are currently used only in
      the defobj, collections, and activity libraries; these libraries
      document the specific classes that provide subclassing support.</PARA>

    <PARA>In general, classes that implement a library are not
      automatically available for use as superclasses. Any library must
      document those specific superclasses that are valid for user classes
      to subclass from, along all the rules that a user subclass must follow
      when implementing new behavior.</PARA></SECT1>
