<TITLE>Documentation and Implementation Status</TITLE>

<PARA>
The current interfaces defined in defobj are expected to remain
stable, with the exception of those relating to package structure and
custom-generated classes. Those facilities are in process of being
totally replaced, and will not be documented further until that
replacement is complete. Details of support for defining a customized
type will also be provided later.
</PARA>

<PARA>
All the interfaces defined in the header file are currently
implemented, except for the various types of zones that would hold all
allocated storage in a collection of local pages, and that would
provide automatic reclaim of unused storage. The current zone
implementation supports all defined allocation messages, and also
maintains the population of the zone that consists of all objects
created directly within it.
</PARA>

<PARA>
The Usage Guide section is only a start, but it does include
subsections that discuss the style of Objective C programming adopted
for use throughout Swarm. There is a full set of Interface Reference
sections, though some details remain to be filled in.

Throughout the documentation, a parenthesized comment that starts with
(.. indicates an editorial comment on the current status of
implementation or documentation.
