<TITLE>Library Interface Conventions</TITLE>

<SECT1>
<TITLE>Overview</TITLE> <PARA>Some of the basic Swarm libraries are
implemented using object definition conventions established by the
<LINK LINKEND="SWARM.DEFOBJ.SGML.REFERENCE">defobj library</LINK>. This document
explains how to read and interpret the header files and interface
definitions published by such libraries. It also explains the typical
structure of documentation provided for libraries that follow these
conventions.</PARA>

</SECT1>

<SECT1>
<TITLE>Library Header File</TITLE>

<PARA>For a library that adopts these conventions, a library is not merely a
collection of source files that are compiled into a library archive
under control of a make file. Instead, Objective C source files in the
library are processed in a special way to publish their definitions
not only as header files, but as generated objects available at
runtime to make full use of the library. A library processed in this
way is referred to as as a "package." (Note: some of the newer Swarm
libraries, such as objectbase and random, don't undergo this special
processing and yet still follow all the library interface conventions
described in this document.)</PARA>

<PARA>The <LINK LINKEND="SWARM.DEFOBJ.SGML.REFERENCE">defobj</LINK>
library documents the full details of special processing performed on
a package. For simply using a library, the key fact to keep in mind is
that the entire public interface to a library is declared in the one
header file having the same name as the package itself, plus a
trailing .h suffix. Additionally, the header file of a library
normally documents only its public interface, in a way that is
completely separated from the implementation of the objects it
specifies.</PARA>

<PARA>The separation of implementation means that a library publishes its
interface entirely without reference to any Objective C classes which
implement its objects. Even though classes are often thought of as
separating the interface of an object from its implementation, this
separation is far from complete. Not only do classes typically contain
many internal methods not intended for external use, but they also
define a particular storage format for an object defined as instance
variables.</PARA>

<PARA>A library instead publishes its interface as a set of public object
types. These object types may also be supplemented by global object
constants called symbols. Both these kinds of definitions normally
appear only in the header file of a library. The remaining source
files in a library normally contain the classes which implement the
object types.</PARA>

<PARA>In a library, the files which implement classes (including class
header files), need not ever be referenced simply to make use of the
implemented capabilities of the library object types. Documentation
for the library is normally expressed entirely in terms of the types
and symbols published in the library header file. If a feature does
not appear in the library header file, it should not be considered
part of a supported public interface.</PARA>

<PARA>Individual class header files are required to subclass from existing
implementations, but interfaces for subclassing are an entirely
separate issue from normal public use of an object library. Class
inheritance can be a powerful implementation technique, but extension
of an existing class framework is typically safe only if performed in
explicitly permitted ways. If a library supports subclassing at all,
it must carefully state which classes may be subclassed and in what
ways. For a library package, this information is supplied outside the
library header file. The library header file specifies only the
interfaces by which objects are intended to be used, whether
implemented by a local class or an external subclass.</PARA>

<PARA>Remaining sections of this document explain the declarations which
appear in a library header file, and end with a suggested structure of
documentation to be provided for a library. The libraries of Swarm
mostly follow this structure.</PARA>

</SECT1>

<SECT1>
<TITLE>Object Type Definitions</TITLE>

<PARA>The interfaces to objects defined by a library are specified by
object type definitions. An object type defines only a set of messages
which may be sent to an object over various phases of its lifetime. An
object type makes no commitment to the classes that might be used to
implement the object.</PARA>

<PARA>Multiple classes may all implement the same messages belonging to a
type. The independence of types and classes means that different
classes can provide alternate implementations of the same object
type. For example, a particular implementing class might be selected
to optimize the implementation for a particular case.</PARA>

<PARA>Object types are similar to protocols defined by Objective C,
and the declarations appearing in a library header file are a minor
adaptation of Objective C protocol syntax. A key difference from
protocols is that object types are published as real external objects
that may be used at runtime to create instances of a type.  A further
difference is that the object types of the <LINK LINKEND="SWARM.DEFOBJ.SGML.REFERENCE">defobj library</LINK> are divided into separate
interfaces that define distinct phases of an object's life
cycle.</PARA>

<TITLE>GridTurtle example</TITLE>

<PARA>An example will help illustrate the features of type definitions
supported by the defobj library. Throughout documentation of the basic
Swarm libraries, a series of running examples will be based on a
simple type of object belonging to sample Swarm simulations. This type
of object is an agent that move around on a two-dimensional grid,
always moving in a current direction that it maintains
internally. This agent is like a "turtle" of the original Logo system,
except that its position is constrained to discrete integer values of
its X-Y coordinates, and its direction is always one of the four
orthogonal directions north, east, south, or west.</PARA>

<PARA>Following is a complete library header file for a library which defines such an object, called GridTurtle:</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>
<![ CDATA [

/*
Name:         GridTurtle.h
Description:  object type for Swarm example programs
Library:      grid
*/

#import <defobj.h>

@deftype GridTurtle <Create, Drop, CREATABLE>
CREATING
- (void)        setXLocMax: (int)xLocMax;
- (void)        setYLocMax: (int)yLocMax;
SETTING

- (void)        setYLoc: (int)yLoc;
- (void)        setXLoc: xLoc setYLoc: yLoc;

- (void)        setDirection: direction;

- (void)        print;
@end

#import "grid.xt"


]]>
</PROGRAMLISTING>

<PARA>An object type is defined by an @deftype declaration. (Note:
newer libraries, including objectbase and random, now follow the
library interface conventions without using this special @deftype
tag. Instead they use just an ordinary @protocol declaration, but
otherwise they follow all the structure explained in this document.)
The syntax of such declaration is identical to that of an Objective C
@protocol definition, except for the entirely uppercase keywords
(CREATABLE, CREATING, SETTING, USING) appearing in the GridTurtle
example above. All these modifications of Objective C syntax are
accomplished by simple preprocessor macros; no extensions to the
language compiler are involved.</PARA>

<PARA>When this library header file is processed (by a special rule in
a make file), an external object id with the name GridTurtle is
automatically published. The name of a defined type becomes an
ordinary object that accepts specific messages defined by the defobj
library. The <LINK LINKEND="SWARM.DEFOBJ.SGML.REFERENCE">defobj
library</LINK> explains the details of such messages; the only purpose
here is to explain the basic sections of a deftype declaration.</PARA>

<PARA>deftype declarations follow the syntax as Objective C protocols
for inheriting messages from each other: a list of names enclosed in
angle brackets (e.g., &lt;Create, Drop, ...&gt; above) gives the names
of other declared types containing messages to be supported by the new
type as well. (These types referenced here are defined by the imported
file &lt;defobj.h&gt;.)  Like protocols, full multiple inheritance of
types is supported. The same messages may be inherited any number of
times through any path with no different effect than if inherited or
declared just once, so long as no conflicts occur in any of their
argument or return types.</PARA>

<PARA>The CREATABLE tag appearing in the inherited type list above is
a special type which defines no messages of its own, but merely marks
the type as one which supports direct creation of instances of the
type. Without this tag, the only role of a type is to define messages
for inheritance by other types. With this tag, the global type object
has a particular implementation that supports object creation using
standard messages defined in defobj.</PARA>

<PARA>The declared messages of the type may be separated into sections
marked by the special uppercase tags such as CREATING, SETTING, and
USING above. (Currently, these are the only such tags which may
occur.) These sections each define messages belonging to a particular
defined "interface" of the object type, which are further combined
into distinct "phases" of an object lifecycle supported by defobj
messages. Further explanation of the interfaces and phases defined by
this example are provided in the Usage Guide of the defobj
library.</PARA>

The following line at the end of the <grid.h> header file above
is required as part of the standard conventions for coding a library
header file: This line adds no information to the header file, but is
required as part of the system by which definitions are automatically
generated.

<TITLE>Global Object Symbols</TITLE>

<PARA>The <FILENAME>grid.h</FILENAME> header file above also contains
the declaration:

<PROGRAMLISTING>

<![ CDATA [
id <Symbol>  North, East, South, West;
]]>
</PROGRAMLISTING></PARA>

<PARA>Lines that declare global id variables of type Symbol,
EventType, Warning, or Error (using the angle bracket syntax of id
variables conforming to a protocol) are processed somewhat like
deftype declarations in that they also produce global id variables
initialized to support particular messages defined by defobj. These
global variables, however, are not used to define or implement other
message interfaces, but only to define certain fixed capabilities
referenced through their global object names.</PARA>

<PARA>If declared as a Symbol, as in the case here, the generated
objects have no particular behavior of their own (other than the
character string of their name), but only serve to define unique
global id constants which may be used as distinct named values in
messages. In this example, the current direction of a GridTurtle
object is represented by one of the symbol names North, East, South,
or West. These values are like the enum constants of the C language,
except that they are defined as full Objective C objects, and may be
used with further restrictions. An EventType, or a Warning or Error,
defines a further subtype of a Symbol constant with further
specialized messages documented in defobj.</PARA>

</SECT1> 

<SECT1>
<TITLE>Interface Design Convention</TITLE>

<PARA>A variety of rules on naming and declaration of object types,
symbols, and messages are followed by many of the Swarm
libraries. These rules help establish a basic consistency on the
library interfaces. Following is a list of such conventions that apply
to a public library interface, some but not all of which are derived
from standard Smalltalk or Objective C coding practice:</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST>

<LISTITEM><PARA>Names of global object constants are capitalized. In
       the public interface, such names include types and
       symbols.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>Recapitalization separates words of a compound name
       (e.g., GridTurtle).  Underscores are generally not used.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>Message names start with a lower-case character, and
       are named using verbs.  Nouns that represent gettable or
       settable components of object state (e.g., Direction of a
       GridTurtle), are prefixed by get or set to indicate the action
       being performed.</PARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><PARA>The Smalltalk convention that a message return the
       receiver of a message if there is no other specific return
       value is generally *not* followed. If there is no specific
       return value needed from a message the return type is declared
       (void).</PARA>
</LISTITEM>

<TITLE>Documentation Structure</TITLE>

<PARA>The following standard sections of documentation are suggested for
libraries that follow the strict interface vs. implementation
separation of library packages, each with purpose and typical contents
as given:</PARA>

<ITEMIZEDLIST>

<LISTITEM><FORMALPARA> <TITLE>Usage Guide</TITLE> <PARA>Tutorial
   introduction to a library. Focuses on the most common uses in an
   order reflecting the needs of a first-time user. Most explanation
   by means of progressively elaborated examples. Serves as a guided
   tour of major library capabilities. No attempt at reference-style
   completeness.</PARA></FORMALPARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><FORMALPARA> <TITLE>Advanced Usage Guide</TITLE> <PARA>
   Continues overview of all significant capabilities of a library,
   including those which might be needed by advanced users customizing
   or extending built-in capability.  Provides examples of specialized
   uses extending beyond normal, basic usage, but still using built-in
   features of the library framework. Helps to simplify the Usage
   Guide by providing a location for overflow of more advanced
   features.</PARA></FORMALPARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><FORMALPARA> <TITLE>Interface Reference</TITLE> <PARA>
   Complete, concise summary of all features of a library. Fills the
   role a Unix "man page" in providing comprehensive definition of
   library services. Little or no concern to provide path of tutorial
   introduction. Does not contain extended examples, at most only
   fragments of examples which serve needs of specification.
</PARA></FORMALPARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><FORMALPARA> <TITLE>Subclassing Reference</TITLE> <PARA>
   Documents the rules for writing new classes which subclass from
   classes that implement the library. Because a library might use
   complex combinations of classes to implement the range of behaviors
   defined by its types, the classes in a library are not
   automatically usable as superclasses of user-defined classes. Each
   library documents which classes are available for use as
   superclasses, and the specific rules that must be followed when
   subclassing from these classes.</PARA></FORMALPARA>
</LISTITEM>

<LISTITEM><FORMALPARA> <TITLE>Implementation Notes</TITLE><PARA>
   Explains the structure of classes by which the types of a library
   are implemented.  Summarizes the status of implementation if still
   incomplete and lists items of possible future work. Provides
   overview and high-level structure of the implementation in whatever
   ways would best guide a reader of implementation source code. May
   also discuss tradeoffs considered along with references to related
   or supporting work.</PARA></FORMALPARA>
