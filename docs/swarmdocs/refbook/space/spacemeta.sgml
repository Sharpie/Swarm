<ABSTRACT>
<TITLE>Documentation and Implementation Status</TITLE>

<PARA>Swarm is an open ended system which is meant to grow in response
to the requirements of the user base, either by inhouse development or
through user re-contributions. We are therefore maintaining a list of
the most popular requests (both in terms of tools and libraries) so
that groups of users can recognize common requirements, make more
informed suggestions and so forth:
</PARA>

<PARA>
A 'Double' Space

       Which could deal with notions of "distance" and answer
       questions of the form: "which other objects are within X radius
       of me"? An initial implementation of such a space has been
       re-contributed by Ginger Booth and may serve as a good
       foundation for such a space.
</PARA>

<PARA>
Complete Batch-Mode Support

Swarm can now run in batch mode, which should allow the user to
organize large parameter sweeps over the models s/he is
implementing. However, we still need to provide adequate and
standardized support for file operations (it should be easy, for
example, to load the parameters of an experiment from a file). In
order to do this we will provide File objects which will allow users
to avoid ad-hoc coding of their file-I/O. This support will be in
place well before V1.0.
</PARA>

<PARA>
More Analysis Tools The averager object can generate the Mean, Max,
Min, and Count of a given input stream. We would like to add similar
tools to calculate entropies, mutual information and other such
measures.
