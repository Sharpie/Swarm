    <PARA>The Swarm Space library is the beginnings of a library to
      assist in building environments for interacting agents. In
      general, environments can be just as varied as the agents
      themselves (in one view, the environment itself is simply
      another agent). However, many simulations have similar types of
      environments that can be helpfully supported by generic
      code.</PARA>

    <PARA>The current space library only addresses simple kinds of
      discretized 2d space. Improvement is planned in the
      future. Briefly, coordinates need to be elevated to the status
      of objects, which should hopefully allow spaces of different
      scales and boundary conditions to interact through a common
      reference system. In addition, other types of spaces are
      desired: continuous coordinates, other dimensions, arbitrary
      graphs, etc</PARA>
