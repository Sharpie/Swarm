<PARA>The Swarm Space library is the beginnings of a library to assist
in building environments for interacting agents. In general,
environments can be just as varied as the agents themselves (in one
view, the environment itself is simply another agent). However, many
simulations have similar types of environments that can be helpfully
supported by generic code.</PARA>

<PARA>The current space library only addresses simple kinds of
discretized 2d space. Improvement is planned in the future: see the
todo list for ideas. Briefly, coordinates need to be elevated to the
status of objects, which should hopefully allow spaces of different
scales and boundary conditions to interact through a common reference
system. In addition, other types of spaces are desired: continuous
coordinates, other dimensions, arbitrary graphs, etc</PARA>
