      <PARA>
        The Swarm project was initiated by Chris Langton, formerly of
        the Santa Fe Institute now at the Swarm Corporation, New
        Mexico.  The current Swarm team is Roger Burkhart (John
        Deere), Marcus Daniels (SFI), Vladimir Jojic (SFI) and Alex
        Lancaster (SFI).  Irene Lee (also formerly of SFI) continues
        to be involved in documentation and Swarm user community
        efforts such as SwarmFest.  Much of the early development of
        Swarm was done by Nelson Minar, who is now at the MIT Media
        Lab, and Manor Askenazi and Glen Ropella (Swarm Corporation),
        both formerly of the SFI.  The random library was written by
        Sven Thommesen and graciously contributed.  Eric Carr and JJ
        Merelo have been patient Swarm users and developers.  Howard
        Gutowitz and David Hiebeler have participated in the design
        process.  (David is also the implementor of the original Swarm
        prototype.)  And, many thanks to Simon Fraser, Swarm graphic
        designer extraordinaire.  Finally, many thanks go out to the
        Swarm user community, particularly those who have stuck with
        us from the beginning.
