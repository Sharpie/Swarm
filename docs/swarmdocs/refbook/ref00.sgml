      <PARA>
        The Swarm project was started by Chris Langton, formerly of
        the Santa Fe Institute now at the Swarm Corporation, New
        Mexico.  Swarm is being designed and programmed by Chris
        Langton (SFI), Roger Burkhart (John Deere), Irene Lee (SFI),
        Marcus Daniels (SFI) and Alex Lancaster (SFI).  Much of the
        development of Swarm was done by Nelson Minar, who is now at
        the MIT Media Lab, and Manor Askenazi and Glen Ropella,
        formerly of the SFI.  The new random library was written by
        Sven Thommesen and graciously contributed.  Eric Carr and JJ
        Merelo have been patient Swarm users and developers. Howard
        Gutowitz and David Hiebeler have participated in the design
        process.  (David is also the implementor of the original Swarm
        prototype.)  And, many thanks to Simon Fraser, Swarm graphic
        designer extraordinaire.  Finally, many thanks go out to the
        Swarm user community, particularly those who have stuck with
        us from the beginning.
