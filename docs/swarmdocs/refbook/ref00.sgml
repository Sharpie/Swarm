      <TITLE>Acknowledgments</TITLE>

      <PARA>The Swarm project was initiated by Chris Langton (now at
      the Swarm Corporation).  Roger Burkhart (John Deere, now at
      VantagePoint Network), Nelson Minar (now at the MIT Media Lab), Glen
      Ropella (now at Swarm Corporation), Manor Askenazi (now at Coopers &
      Lybrand), Irene Lee (SDG), Vladimir Jojic (UIUC), and Alex Lancaster
      (Santa Fe Institute) have all been active in the design and
      programming of Swarm.  Marcus Daniels is the current maintainer and
      lead developer at the SDG.</para>

    <para>Much of the early development of Swarm was done by Nelson
      Minar, who is now at the MIT Media Lab, and Manor Askenazi and
      Glen Ropella (Swarm Corporation), both formerly of the SFI.
      The random library was written by Sven Thommesen and
      graciously contributed.  Eric Carr and JJ Merelo have been
      patient Swarm users and developers.  Howard Gutowitz and David
      Hiebeler have participated in the design process.  (David is
      also the implementor of the original Swarm prototype.)  And,
      many thanks to Simon Fraser, Swarm graphic designer
      extraordinaire.  Finally, many thanks go out to the Swarm user
      community, particularly those who have stuck with us from the
      beginning.
