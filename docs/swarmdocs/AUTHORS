   			    The Swarm Team

The Swarm project is based at the Santa Fe Institute, New Mexico.

The Swarm project was initiated by Chris Langton (now at the Swarm
Corporation).  Roger Burkhart (John Deere), Nelson Minar (now at the
MIT Media Lab), Glen Ropella (now at Swarm Corporation) Manor Askenazi
and Irene Lee have all been active in the design and programming of
Swarm.  The current Swarm team at the SFI consists of Marcus Daniels,
Vladimir Jojic and Alex Lancaster.

                                  Sincerely,
                                  The Hive at SFI
