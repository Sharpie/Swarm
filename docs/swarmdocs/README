This directory tree holds the current Swarm documentation in the raw
XML format.  In combination with the Swarm source corresponding to
this documentation, HTML and XSL-FO (which can be converted into PDF)
formats may be generated.

Note:

The XSL-FO output generated by this package can be transformed into
PDF by PassiveTeX (http://www.tei-c.org.uk/Software/passivetex/) or
Apache Fop (http://xml.apache.org/fop), but because of the complexity
of installing these packages, this is currently not included as part
of the swarmdocs build.  See the respective packages for details of
how to turn an .fo file into a .pdf.

The file INSTALL in this directory gives detailed instructions on the
building and installation of the documentation.

----

Requirements:

Building this documentation requires a number of packages:

* xsltproc - an XML parser, takes the XML source included in this
  package, and the specified XML DTD and XSLT stylesheets (see below)
  to generate the desired back-end: html and fo (which can be turned
  into pdf), this is part of the libxml2/libxslt suite, see
  xmlsoft.org for more details of how to install this on your system
* GNU emacs - used to parse the in-code documentation
* gs - Aladdin Ghostscript version 4.00 or later
* pngtopnm, pngtops - converts png files to pnm and ps files, respectively.
* cjpeg - compresses an image file to a JPEG file 

Two further packages are also required: 

* The DocBook XML DTD (V4.2)

The XML documentation is marked up using the DocBook XML V4.2 DTD
maintained by OASIS, aimed at computer documentation.  The current
version can be found at:

  http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/

The Official Docbook documentation ("DocBook: The Definitive Guide" by
Norman Walsh and Leonard Muellner) is available at:

  http://docbook.org/

* The modular DocBook XSLT stylesheets 

The DocBook stylesheets are used to parse the Swarm XML in conjunction
with the DocBook DTD and generate the html and fo output.  The current
version required is listed in the Release Notes section in NEWS and
can be found at:

  http://docbook.sourceforge.net/

----

The file `configure' is a shell script to acclimate the creation of
the documentation to the oddities of your processor and operating
system.  It creates the file `Makefile' (a script for the `make'
program), which automates the process of building and installing the
documentation.  See INSTALL for more detailed information.

----

Note: The version numbers for Swarm documentation and source releases
are independent and can be increased without affecting the other
numbers.  Generally, at major releases, the version numbers will be
synchronised to match latest release of the source code.
