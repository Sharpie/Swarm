This directory tree holds the current Swarm documentation in the raw
SGML format.  In combination with the Swarm source corresponding to
this documentation, the html, dvi, PostScript and RTF formats may be
generated.

The file INSTALL in this directory gives detailed instructions on the
building and installation of the documentation.

----

Requirements:

Building this documentation requires a number of packages:

* jade - a DSSSL parser, takes the SGML source included in this
  package, and the specified SGML DTD and DSSSL stylesheets (see below) 
  to generate the desired back-end: html, tex and rtf.
* GNU emacs - used to parse the in-code documentation
* jadetex - version of tex equipped with macros generated by jade
* gs - Aladdin Ghostscript version 4.00 or later
* dvips - converts dvi documents to Postscript
* pngtopnm, pngtops - converts png files to pnm and ps files, respectively.
* cjpeg - compresses an image file to a JPEG file 

Two further packages are also required: 

* The DocBook DTD (V3.0)

The SGML documentation is marked up using the DocBook V3.0 DTD
(formerly maintained by the Davenport Group - now maintained by
OASIS), aimed at computer documentation.  The current version can be
found at:

  http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/docbook/index.html

[Note: the Official Docbook documentation, in both HTML and Docbook
form, is still located on the Davenport Project web server
(http://www.ora.com/davenport/).  Copies of the Overview, User's
Guide, Reference, and Maintainer's Guide are available here as
well. Note that only the Reference has been updated for DocBook 3.0.]
  
* The modular DocBook stylesheets 

The DocBook stylesheets are used to parse the Swarm SGML in
conjunction with the DocBook DTD and generate the html, tex and rtf
output.  The current version required is listed in the Release Notes
section in NEWS and can be found at:

  http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl/

----

The file `configure' is a shell script to acclimate the creation of
the documentation to the oddities of your processor and operating
system.  It creates the file `Makefile' (a script for the `make'
program), which automates the process of building and installing the
documentation.  See INSTALL for more detailed information.

----

Note: The version numbers for Swarm documentation and source releases
are independent and can be increased without affecting the other
numbers.  Generally, at major releases, the version numbers will be
synchronised to match latest release of the source code.
