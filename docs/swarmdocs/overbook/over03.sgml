  <TITLE>Mag 3x: Swarm Structures</TITLE>

  <PARA>Swarm applications are structured around the concept of the
  Swarm. Swarms are the basic building blocks of Swarm simulations: a
  Swarm is a combination of a collection of objects and a schedule of
  activity over those objects. The collection are like the matter of
  the Swarm and the schedule is like the arrow of time moving the
  objects forward.</PARA>

  <SECT1>
    <TITLE>Model Swarms</TITLE> 

    <PARA>In our current demos, Swarm applications contain two
    swarms. At the core is the <EMPHASIS>model swarm</EMPHASIS>, the
    Swarm that encapsulates the simulated model. Everything in the
    model swarm corresponds to objects in the world being modeled. For
    instance, in Heatbugs the HeatbugModelSwarm contains a collection
    of Heatbug agents, a HeatSpace to represent a physical property of
    the world, antion of Heatbug agents, a HeatSpace to represent a
    physical property of the world, and a Grid2d to store agent
    position.</PARA>

    <PARA>In addition to the object collection, the model swarm also
    contains a schedule of activity on the model. The schedule defines
    the effect of passing time on the model. For the simple heatbugs
    schedule, the execution is simply to update the HeatSpace
    (diffusing heat across the world) and then telling each Heatbug
    agent to move itself. </PARA>

    <PARA>Model swarms consist of a set of inputs and outputs. The
    inputs to the HeatbugModelSwarm are model parameters: things like
    the size of the world, the number of HeatBugs, and the diffusion
    rate of heat. The outputs of the HeatbugModelSwarm are the
    observables of the model: the individual Heatbugs, the
    distribution of heat across the world, etc. </PARA>

    <TITLE>Observer Swarms</TITLE> <PARA>The model swarm alone defines
    the simulated world. But an experiment does not just consist of
    the objects being experimented upon, it also includes the
    experimental apparatus used for observation and measurements. In
    Swarm computer simulations, those observation objects are placed
    in an <EMPHASIS>observer swarm</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>

   <PARA>The most important object in an observer swarm is the model
    swarm that is being studied. The model swarm is one component of
    the observer, kind of like a little world in a petri dish on the
    lab bench. Other observer objects can then input data into the
    model swarm (setting simulation parameters, for instance) and read
    data out of the model swarm (collecting statistics of the behavior
    of agents).</PARA>

   <PARA>Just as in setting up a model swarm, an observer swarm has a
    collection of objects (the instrumentation), a schedule of
    activity, and a set of inputs and outputs. The activity of the
    observer schedule is to drive data collection - read this number
    out of the model, draw it on a graph. The inputs to the observer
    swarm are configurations of the observer tools: what sorts of
    graphs to generate, for instance. The outputs are the
    observations.</PARA>

   <PARA>When running in graphics mode, the observer swarm objects are
    largely used to mediate user interface. For instance, in Heatbugs
    the HeatbugObserverSwarm creates Raster widgets, EZGraphs, and
    Probes. All of these objects are connected into the HeatbugModel
    swarm to read data, and to graphical interface objects so the
    human sitting in front of the computer can observe the world.</PARA>

    <PARA>Interactive, graphical experimentation with models is useful
    for coming up with intuitions. But for serious experimentation it
    is necessary to collect statistics, which means doing many runs
    and storing data for analysis.  As an alternative to a graphical
    observer swarm, you can also create <EMPHASIS>batch
    swarms</EMPHASIS>, observer swarms that are intended to be run
    without any interaction at all. Instead of putting up fancy
    graphics, batch swarms read data from files to control the model
    and write the data out to other files for analysis.  The key here
    is that the model swarm used in the batch swarm is the exact same
    model as that used in a graphical observer swarm: the only
    difference is what tools the observer (batch or graphical)
    connects to the model.</PARA>

    <TITLE>Summary</TITLE> 
  
    <PARA>Multiple Swarms are used to create an experimental apparatus
    and control it. The use of multiple Swarms is not restricted only
    to this use, though: in particular, a model Swarm could itself
    contain its own subswarms, building a hierarchical simulation. In
    future Swarm development, we intend to use the power of the
    multiple Swarm modeling approach to build complicated and flexible
    models.</PARA>
