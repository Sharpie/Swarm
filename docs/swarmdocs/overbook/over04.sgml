  <PARA>Now that we have multiple Swarms and an experimental
  apparatus, it's time to learn how to use the objects themselves
  inside an application. Some examples are provided here: to
  understand this better, it will be necessary to read through example
  applications and the library documentation. These examples come from
  the Heatbugs application.</PARA>

  <SECT1>
    <TITLE>Building a Model Swarm</TITLE> 

    <PARA>The key component of a simulation is the model Swarm. Here
    is the definition of a HeatbugModelSwarm, from
    HeatbugModelSwarm.h</PARA>

    <PROGRAMLISTING>
      
@interface HeatbugModelSwarm : Swarm {
 int numBugs; // simulation parameters
 double evaporationRate;
 double diffuseConstant;
 int worldXSize, worldYSize;
 int minIdealTemp, maxIdealTemp;
 int minOutputHeat, maxOutputHeat;
 double randomMoveProbability;

 id modelActions; // scheduling data structures
 id modelSchedule;

 id heatbugList; // list of all the heatbugs
 Grid2d * world; // objects representing
 HeatSpace * heat; // the world
}

-getHeatbugList; // access methods into the
-(Grid2d *) getWorld; // model swarm. These methods
-(HeatSpace *) getHeat; // allow the model swarm to be observed.

+createBegin: aZone; // extra methods you
-createEnd; // provide for Swarms
-buildObjects;
-buildActions;
-activateIn: swarmContext;

    </PROGRAMLISTING>

    <PARA>The first section of code says that a HeatbugModelSwarm is a
    kind of Swarm.  HeatbugModelSwarm inherits a lot of behavior from
    generic Swarm, but also adds new variables and methods.</PARA>

    <PARA>The new variables are enclosed in the braces in the definition
    of HeatbugModelSwarm.  They are split into three general classes
    of things: simulation parameters, schedule data structures, and
    objects in the world. This is a typical sort of model swarm.</PARA>

    <PARA>Finally, a HeatbugModelSwarm defines new methods. The first
    few methods are used to allow the model to be observed: a
    HeatbugModelSwarm will give out its list of Heatbugs, for
    instance, or its HeatSpace. Observers use these methods to monitor
    the model.</PARA>

    <PARA>In addition to the observation methods, there are several
    Swarm-specific methods for the building of Swarms. These are
    fairly stereotyped. The <LITERAL>createBegin</LITERAL> and
    <LITERAL>createEnd</LITERAL> messages are used to create the Swarm
    object itself.  <LITERAL>buildObjects</LITERAL> builds the model
    objects, and <LITERAL>buildActions</LITERAL> builds the model
    schedule - more on these later. Finally,
    <LITERAL>activateIn</LITERAL> arranges for the execution machinery
    to execute the Swarm itself. </PARA>

  </SECT1>

  <SECT1>
    <TITLE>Defining an Agent</TITLE>

    <PARA>The agents are typically the real focus of a modeling
    effort. Most of the work in a simulation comes in defining the
    agent behavior so that the computer agents resemble the real world
    phenomena you are trying to create.</PARA>

    <PARA>In the case of Heatbugs, agents are pretty simple. Here is
    their definition, from Heatbug.h:</PARA>

    <PROGRAMLISTING>
      
@interface Heatbug: SwarmObject {
 double unhappiness; // my current unhappiness
 int x, y; // my spatial coordinates
 HeatValue idealTemperature; // my ideal temperature
 HeatValue outputHeat; // how much heat I put out
 float randomMoveProbability; // chance of moving randomly

 Grid2d * world; // the world I live in
 int worldXSize, worldYSize; // how big that world is
 HeatSpace * heat; // the heat for the world
 Color bugColor; // my colour (display)
}

-setWorld: (Grid2d *) w Heat: (HeatSpace *) h; // which world are we in?
-createEnd;

-(double) getUnhappiness;

-setIdealTemperature: (HeatValue) i;
-setOutputHeat: (HeatValue) o;
-setRandomMoveProbability: (float) p;
-setX: (int) x Y: (int) y; // bug's position
-setBugColor: (Color) c; // bug's colour (display)

-step;

-drawSelfOn: (id &lt;Raster&gt;) r;

</PROGRAMLISTING>

    <PARA>Heatbug is a subclass of SwarmObject. SwarmObjects have very
    little behavior of their own - they are defined as the root class
    of most objects and control computer science aspects like memory
    allocation and probability.</PARA>

    <PARA>Heatbug carry with them a variety of state variables. For
    instance, each Heatbug has a notion of its ideal temperature,
    which will affect it's behavior. In addition, Heatbugs have
    variables that let them know about the world: these agents are
    storing references to the HeatSpace object, for example.</PARA>

    <PARA> Most of the Heatbug methods have to do with setting up the
    agents state - the inputs to a Heatbug. Every heatbug must set up
    its world and heat objects, via the
    <LITERAL>setWorld:Heat:</LITERAL> method. In addition when
    Heatbugs are created they have their ideal temperature set, their
    output heat, etc.  Heatbugs are also observable. Heatbugs define a
    <LITERAL>getUnhappiness</LITERAL> method - the unhappiness is the
    major measurable aspect of a heatbug, how well optimized it is at
    the moment. They also have a <LITERAL>drawSelfOn</LITERAL> method
    that directs the heatbug to draw itself on the specified graphics
    widget.</PARA>

    <PARA>Finally, and most importantly, a Heatbug has a
    <LITERAL>step</LITERAL> method.  <LITERAL>step</LITERAL> is where
    the Heatbugs behavior is defined: every time the Heatbug is told
    to step it performs its internal calculations, choosing where to
    move. Each heatbug is told to <LITERAL>step</LITERAL> when
    appropriate by the model schedule. The code for
    <LITERAL>step</LITERAL> is the real intellectual input into the
    model, and is worth reading as an example of an agent's
    behavior.</PARA>

    </SECT1>

  <SECT1>

    <TITLE>Building Agents</TITLE>


    <PARA>Now that Heatbugs have been defined, the model swarm needs
    to create them.  This code fragment is from the
    <LITERAL>buildObjects</LITERAL> method on HeatbugModelSwarm.</PARA>

    <PROGRAMLISTING>

// A loop to create a bunch of heatbugs.
for (i = 0; i &lt; numBugs; i++) 
 {
  Heatbug * hbug;
  int idealTemp, outputHeat;

  // Choose a random ideal temperature, output heat from the specified
  // range (model parameters).
  idealTemp = [uniformRandom rMin: minIdealTemp Max: maxIdealTemp];
  outputHeat = [uniformRandom rMin: minOutputHeat Max: maxOutputHeat];

  // Create the heatbug, set the creation time variables
  hbug = [Heatbug createBegin: [self getZone]];
  [hbug setWorld: world Heat: heat];
  hbug = [hbug createEnd];

  // Add the bug to the end of the list.
  [heatbugList addLast: hbug];

  // Now initialize the rest of the heatbug's state.
  [hbug setIdealTemperature: idealTemp];
  [hbug setOutputHeat: outputHeat];
  [hbug setX: [uniformRandom rMax: worldXSize] // random position
         Y: [uniformRandom rMax: worldYSize]];
}
    </PROGRAMLISTING>
 
    <PARA>The details of this code are best explained in reading the
    documentation for the libraries and the heatbugs demo application
    itself. Essentially, we first generate two random numbers: an
    ideal temperature and an output heat for the new Heatbug. We then
    create the Hheatbug itself with <LITERAL>createBegin</LITERAL> and
    fill in the required parameters of world and heat. Once those are
    set, we can send <LITERAL>createEnd</LITERAL> to the Heatbug and
    it is finished being created. After it's done being created we add
    it into a list of Heatbugs in the model and set a few parameters
    on it like the ideal temperature and the initial position.</PARA>

    </SECT1>
  
  <SECT1>
    <TITLE>Building Space objects</TITLE>

    <PARA> In Swarm, spaces are really just another kind of agent. In
    the heatbugs model we create a HeatSpace, a subclass of a
    diffusion object from the Swarm space libaries (specified in
    HeatSpace.m). Here is the code from
    <LITERAL>buildObjects</LITERAL> in the HeatbugModelSwarm.</PARA>

    <PROGRAMLISTING>

heat = [HeatSpace createBegin: [self getZone]];
[heat setSizeX: worldXSize Y: worldYSize];
[heat setDiffusionConstant: diffuseConstant];
[heat setEvaporationRate: evaporationRate];
heat = [heat createEnd];

    </PROGRAMLISTING>


    <PARA> the object is created, a few parameters are set, and then
    the creation is finalized.</PARA>

    </SECT1>
  
  <SECT1>
    <TITLE>Scheduling a Model Swarm</TITLE>

    <PARA>Once all of the simulated objects are created in
    <LITERAL>buildObjects</LITERAL>, the next task is to schedule them in the
    method <LITERAL>buildActions</LITERAL>.</PARA>

    <PROGRAMLISTING>
modelActions = [ActionGroup create: [self getZone]];
[modelActions createActionTo: heat message: M(stepRule)];
[modelActions createActionForEach: heatbugList message: M(step)];
[modelActions createActionTo: heat message: M(updateLattice)];

modelSchedule = [Schedule createBegin: [self getZone]];
[modelSchedule setRepeatInterval: 1];
modelSchedule = [modelSchedule createEnd];
[modelSchedule at: 0 createAction: modelActions];
    </PROGRAMLISTING>

    <PARA>The heatbug model schedule actually consists of two
    components: an ActionGroup called <LITERAL>modelActions</LITERAL>
    and a Schedule called <LITERAL>modelSchedule</LITERAL>.  The
    ActionGroup is a tightly coupled list of three messages: every
    time the action group is executed, it will send three messages in
    a row:

      <PROGRAMLISTING>
[heat stepRule];
[heatbugList forEach: step];
[heat updateLattice];
      </PROGRAMLISTING>

     The ActionGroup alone specifies three messages to send - in order
     to put it in the simulation, that ActionGroup is then dropped
     into a Schedule.  The Schedule itself only has one action - to
     execute <LITERAL>modelActions</LITERAL> itself. That action takes
     place at time 0. But because we've set a repeat interval on the
     schedule of 1, the schedule itself loops, executing every 1 time
     step. The final result is that <LITERAL>modelActions</LITERAL> is
     executed at time 0, time 1, etc.</PARA>

    </SECT1>

  <SECT1>
    <TITLE>Building a Graphical Observer Swarm</TITLE> 

    <PARA>With the model swarm defined, arranging for a graphical
      observer Swarm is the next step. For Heatbugs, the code is in
      HeatbugObserverSwarm. The structure of an observer swarm is
      almost exactly like building a model swarm.</PARA>

    <PROGRAMLISTING>
@interface HeatbugObserverSwarm : GUISwarm {
  int displayFrequency; // one parameter: update freq

  id displayActions; // schedule data structs
  id displaySchedule;
  
  HeatbugModelSwarm * heatbugModelSwarm; // the Swarm we're observing
  
  // Lots of display objects. First, widgets
  XColormap * colormap; // allocate colours
  ZoomRaster * worldRaster; // 2d display widget
  EZGraph * unhappyGraph; // graphing widget
  
  // Now, higher order display and data objects
  Value2dDisplay * heatDisplay; // display the heat
  Object2dDisplay * heatbugDisplay; // display the heatbugs
}
    </PROGRAMLISTING>

    <PARA>Again we have input parameters (display frequency), schedule
      data structures, and resident objects (model swarm, display
      widgets). The important exception is that HeatbugObserverSwarm
      is a subclass not just of the generic Swarm class, but
      specifically a GUISwarm. That implies that the
      HeatbugObserverSwarm will contain a control panel to allow the
      user to stop execution, and will also have a special
      <LITERAL>go</LITERAL> method to set everything running.</PARA>

    </SECT1>

  <SECT1>
    <TITLE>Building a Data Graph</TITLE>

    
    <PARA>An example of an object inside the HeatbugObserverSwarm is a
      data graph, the graph of average unhappiness. Here is the code
      necessary to create that object:</PARA>

    <PROGRAMLISTING>
// Create the graph widget to display unhappiness.
unhappyGraph = [EZGraph createBegin: [self getZone]];
[unhappyGraph setTitle: "Unhappiness of bugs vs. time"];
[unhappyGraph setAxisLabelsX: "time" Y: "unhappiness"];
unhappyGraph = [unhappyGraph createEnd] ;

[unhappyGraph createAverageSequence: "unhappiness"
 withFeedFrom: [heatbugModelSwarm getHeatbugList]
 andSelector: M(getUnhappiness)] ;</PROGRAMLISTING>


    <PARA>The first step is to build an instance of an EZGraph and set
      its captions.  Then a Sequence is created inside that graph (in
      this case, an AverageSequence).  In general, the Sequence
      requires a target object and a message with which to extract
      data from that object -- the data is then plotted as one line in
      the graph.</PARA>

    <PARA>In the case of an AverageSequence, an entire collection of
      objects is presented to it. The AverageSequence then extracts
      data from all the objects in the collection (in this case a
      List) using the provided message (in this case
      <LITERAL>getUnhappiness</LITERAL>), and generate a datapoint
      from these values by averaging them.</PARA>

    </SECT1>

  <SECT1>
      <TITLE>The main() function</TITLE>

    <PARA>The last main type of code needed for an application is the
      function <LITERAL>main()</LITERAL> the first function called in
      your program. All the real work has been done already - all
      that's left is to create the objects at the right time.</PARA>

<PROGRAMLISTING>
int main(int argc, const char** argv) 
{ 
 id theTopLevelSwarm ;

 // Swarm initialization: all Swarm apps must call this first.
 initSwarm(argc, argv);

 // swarmGUIMode is set in initSwarm(). It's set to be 1 if you
 // typed heatbugs -batchmode. Otherwise, it's set to 0.

 if (swarmGUIMode == 1)
 // We've got graphics, so make a full ObserverSwarm to get GUI objects
   theTopLevelSwarm = [HeatbugObserverSwarm create: globalZone];
 else
 // No graphics - make a batchmode swarm and run it.
   theTopLevelSwarm = [HeatbugBatchSwarm create: globalZone];

 [theTopLevelSwarm buildObjects];
 [theTopLevelSwarm buildActions];
 [theTopLevelSwarm activateIn: nil];
 [theTopLevelSwarm go];

 // theTopLevelSwarm has finished processing, so it's time to quit.
 return 0;
}</PROGRAMLISTING>

    <PARA><LITERAL>main()</LITERAL> calls <LITERAL>initSwarm</LITERAL>
      (required in all Swarm applications). It then detects if it
      should do graphics or not, creates the appropriate top level
      Swarm to contain the model, and sets it to running. Simple as
      that!</PARA>
