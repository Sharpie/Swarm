<chapter id="SWARM.OVERVIEW.MAG2.CHAPTER">  <title>Mag 2x: Basis of Swarm Computation</title>

  <para>Here is a first approximation to embedding the above outline
   of an experimental procedure in Swarm code:Swarm is implemented in
   the Object-Oriented Programming language Objective-C. Computation
   in a Swarm application takes place by having objects send messages
   to each other. The basic message syntax is:

  <programlisting>  [targetObject message Arg1: var1 Arg2: var2]
  </programlisting>

   Where "targetObject" is the recipient of the message,
   "messageArg1:Arg2:" is the message to send to that object, and
   "var1", "var2", etc, are arguments to pass along with the
   message. Objective C's messages are keyword/value oriented, which
   is why the message name "messageArg1:Arg2:" is interspersed with
   the arguments.
   </para>
  
  <para>The whole idea of Swarm is to provide an execution context
   within which a large number of objects can "live their lives" and
   interact with one another in a distributed, concurrent
   manner. Furthermore, we wish to insulate the user from having to
   master all of the highly baroque computer-science wizardry usually
   required to implement such massively distributed systems of
   autonomous agents reliably and robustly.</para>

  <para>In the context of the Swarm simulation system, the generic
   outline of an experimental procedure takes the following
   form:</para>
    
  <orderedlist>      <listitem><para>Create an artificial universe replete with
       space, time, and objects that can be located, within reason, to
       certain "points" in the overall structure of space and time
       within the universe., and allow these objects to determine
       their own behavior according to their own rules and internal
       state in concert with sampling the state of the world, usually
       only sparsely.</para></listitem>
      
      <listitem><para>Create a number of objects which will serve to
       observe, record, and analyze data produced by the behavior of
       the objects in the artificial universe implemented in step
       1).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Run the universe, moving both the simulation and
       observation objects forward in time under some explicit model
       of concurrency. </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Interact with the experiment via the data
       produced by the instrumentation objects to perform a series of
       controlled experimental runs of the system.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Depending on what is observed in stage 4), alter
       the experimental or instrumental "apparatus" and go back to
       3).</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Publish paper *including* detailed specification
       of the experimental set-up so that others can recreate your
       experiment and verify your results. </para></listitem>

    </orderedlist>
