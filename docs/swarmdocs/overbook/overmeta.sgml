    <TITLE>A Top-Down Introduction To Implementing an Experiment Using
      Swarm</TITLE>
    
    <PARA>This document attempts to explain the logical structure of a
      Swarm experiment application. Starting with a very general outline of
      an idealized experimental procedure, we successively increase the
      level of specification of each stage of this idealized structure until
      we arrive at details of an actual running Swarm application.
    </PARA>
    
    <PARA>Along the way, we introduce and describe (very briefly) some of
      the tools currently available in Swarm to help users build
      experiments. The tools presented here are only suggestive: the Swarm
      library documentation and example applications will give a more
      detailed view of using specific components of Swarm
