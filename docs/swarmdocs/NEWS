* Release Notes for swarmdocs 1.2

** The old HTML for swarmdocs has been reformatted into SGML using the
Davenport DocBook DTD V3.0.

** Most reference information is now generated directly from Swarm source code
and comments embedded in source code.

** GNU automake and autoconf support has been added to enable documentation 
'builds' from source code and SGML markup.

** Build procedure can create 'html', 'dvi', 'ps' and 'rtf' output.

* Release Notes for swarmdocs 1.1

** Never generated.

* Release Notes for versions earlier than 1.1

** No official Release Notes.
