  <ABSTRACT>

    <PARA>The &swarm-webpage; provides a good introduction to Swarm
      (what it does and what it aims to be). On the other hand, the
      The Overview to Swarm aims to give you a more detailed overview
      of the sorts of things a user needs to do in order to get a
      simulation up and running in Swarm. The combination of these two
      documents should help you decide whether Swarm would be a useful
      tool in the context of your research.</PARA>
    
    <PARA>Please direct all questions, bug reports, or suggestions for
      changes to the Swarm developers <EMAIL>swarm@santafe.edu</EMAIL>.
