  <ABSTRACT>
    <TITLE>Overview</TITLE>
    
    <PARA>The Swarm home page (&swarm-webpage;) provides a good
      introduction to Swarm (what it does and what it aims to be). On
      the other hand, the The Overview to Swarm aims to give you a
      more detailed overview of the sorts of things a user needs to do
      in order to get a simulation up and running in Swarm. The
      combination of these two documents should help you decide
      whether Swarm would be a useful tool in the context of your
      research.</PARA>
    
    <PARA>Please direct all questions, bug reports, or suggestions for
      changes to the Swarm developers <LITERAL><ULINK
