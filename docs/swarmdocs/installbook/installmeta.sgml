    Learning to program with Swarm will require
    reading example applications, studying the technical
    reference material and sometimes even getting down to the level of
    reviewing the header files in libraries.  It does currently
    require a good hands-on knowledge of object-oriented programming
    and software development processes in general.</PARA>

    <PARA>Swarm is not yet a `shrink-wrapped' simulation toolkit.
    There are many of those kind of products on the market.  However,
    with these packages, the ease of use comes at a price - you are
    locked into the that vendor's particular modelling paradigm.
    Swarm was intended to embrace many different types of modelling -
    consequently, it can be more difficult for a novice user - but
    more powerful in the long-run.
