  <ABSTRACT><TITLE>Overview</TITLE> 

    <PARA> A full-fledged "User Guide" is forthcoming, but incomplete
    as of writing.  Learning to program with Swarm will require
    reading example applications, studying the (fairly) technical
    reference material and sometimes even getting down to the level of
    reviewing the header files in libraries.  It does currently
    require a good hands-on knowledge of object-oriented programming
    and software development processes in general.</PARA>

    <PARA>Swarm is not intended to be a "shrink-wrapped" simulation
    toolkit "in-a-box".  There are many of those kind of products on
    the market.  However, the ease of use comes at a price - you are
    locked into the that vendor's particular modelling paradigm.
    Swarm was intended to embrace many different types of modelling -
    consequently, it can be more difficult for a novice user - but
    much more powerful in the long-run.
