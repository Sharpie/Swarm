  <SIDEBAR><PARA>Installing Swarm will take some time: various
      external libraries need to be acquired, compiled, and installed,
      and then Swarm itself needs to be compiled. Please report any
      problems during installation back so that we can try to fix them
      in the future.</PARA>

    <PARA>Swarm uses quite a few libraries and is intended to run
      under all major flavors of Unix. This presents the unpleasant
      but largely unavoidable side-effect of making Swarm hard to
      install. Ideally, you should get the sys-admin for your site to
      do the job. In any event, the new online <EMPHASIS>Swarm
        FAQ</EMPHASIS> where we've tried to compile some of the common
      obstacles to installation, may be useful.

          <PARA>Our intention is that Swarm will run on any modern
            Unix/Linux system. Ideally, Swarm itself should be 100%
            portable. Swarm is currently known to be running on SunOS
            4.1.3, Linux, HP/UX, some SGI Irix boxes, MachTen/68k, and
            Solaris.  Some of the software Swarm uses might not be
            entirely portable; these problems are largely out of our
            hands. The major difficulty so far is the tricks the GNU
            Objective C runtime uses may not work properly on AIX and
            MachTen/PPC, so Swarm may not work on those
            systems. Fixing this is a longterm project; if you
            absolutely must use Swarm on AIX or MachTen/PPC, contact
            us.</PARA>

            installing the Cygnus Win32 environment, and a Swarm
            "Install Shield" has been created to install Swarm on
            Windows NT (also replacing the job of installing the

    <TITLE>Configuring and Installing Swarm</TITLE>
    
    <PARA>Once you have all of the above software installed, the next

      into a convenient place <LITERAL>(via gzip -dc swarm-xx.yy.zz.tar.gz
        | tar xf -)</LITERAL>.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>As of the Swarm 1.2 release, the compilation and
      installation of Swarm is handled by a GNU
      <COMMAND>configure</COMMAND> script.  This removes a large
      burden from the user, as <COMMAND>configure</COMMAND> has some
      intelligence which automatically sets many common options.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>You first need to read the file <FILENAME>INSTALL</FILENAME>
      with the release of Swarm, in the top-level source directory, to
      determine the appropriate and recent options to give to the
      <COMMAND>configure</COMMAND> script (this is analogous to what
      you needed to do when editing the *INCDIR macros in the obsolete
      <FILENAME>Makefile.conf</FILENAME> in earlier releases).
    </PARA>
<!--

    <PARA>All configuration of Swarm compilation is localized to the
      file <FILENAME>Makefile.conf</FILENAME>.  You should change the lines
      OTHERINCDIRS and OTHERLIBDIRS to point to the directories where
      the libraries you installed are, and set OTHERLIBS to link in
      other OS-dependent libraries that might be required on your
      system.  In addition, if your OS doesn't have <LITERAL>ranlib</LITERAL>,
      then configure the <LITERAL>RANLIB=</LITERAL> line to just execute
      <LITERAL>/bin/true</LITERAL>.</PARA>

    <PARA>All of the procedures run by make are defined in the three
      top level makefiles <FILENAME>Makefile.conf</FILENAME>,
      <FILENAME>Makefile.lib</FILENAME>, and

      you might need to look at the Makefile code in there.

    <TITLE>Compiling Swarm Libraries -- (not required for binary

    <PARA>You've done the hard part, now type <COMMAND>make</COMMAND>,
      as in earlier releases from the top of the source directory, and
      watch the fun!  If running <COMMAND>make</COMMAND> in the root
      Swarm directory does nothing, you probably aren't running GNU
      Make.</PARA>

    <PARA>There is now an explicit "installation" step to install
      Swarm -- <COMMAND>make install</COMMAND> so that binaries and
      libraries can be installed cleanly to a specified location.  On
      many Unix systems this likely to somewhere like

      and <FILENAME>Makefile.appl</FILENAME>, respectively.  These
      distributed with earlier versions are now generated by
      <COMMAND>configure</COMMAND> .  If you run into problems, the
      right thing to do is to re-run <COMMAND>configure</COMMAND>, and
      re-install Swarm, tinkering with these generated Makefiles
      directly is not recommended.

    <TITLE>Compiling and Running Swarm Applications</TITLE>
    
    <PARA>Swarm applications are distributed separately: you will need
      to download and unpack applications independently. After the
      application is unpacked, you will have to change the
      <LITERAL>SWARMHOME</LITERAL> variable in the Makefile. It is
      setup, by default to point to "../swarm", as if the Swarm
      libraries were in a sibling directory called "swarm". Just edit
      that string to point to where you installed the Swarm
      libraries. No other configuration should be necessary.  For
      example in the Makefile for your Swarm application, change:

<PROGRAMLISTING>
SWARMHOME=../swarm
</PROGRAMLISTING>
to the following format:

<PROGRAMLISTING>
SWARMHOME=&lt;path to where Swarm is installed&gt;
</PROGRAMLISTING>

For example, a typical place a system admin might install Swarm is:

<PROGRAMLISTING>
SWARMHOME=/usr/local/swarm-&lt;version_number&gt;
</PROGRAMLISTING>

      All you need to do now, to compile an application is type
      <COMMAND>make</COMMAND>.</PARA>

    <PARA>Once the application is compiled, just run it out of its own
      directory.  A control panel and a couple of parameter windows
      should pop up; press the "Go" button to watch it
      run. Congratulations!</PARA>

  <SIMPLESECT>
    <TITLE>Post-compile cleanup</TITLE>

    <PARA>After you've tried out the Swarm libraries for awhile you
      may want to clean up the intermediate .o files, and other
      generated files, in the original source directory. Once you have
      done the <COMMAND>make install</COMMAND> you can remove the
      entire source directory, or if you might want to re-install
      later with different option, just type <COMMAND>make
      clean</COMMAND> to clean-up all files generated by the original
      make.  See your the file <FILENAME>INSTALL</FILENAME> in the
      Swarm distribution, for more details.
    </PARA>

    <PARA>
      Just remember to set <LITERAL>$(SWARMHOME)</LITERAL> to the
      right directory in your application's makefile. If you have
      installed Swarm, but for some reason, need to recompile the
      library and want to start from a completely clean source
      directory, you can run <COMMAND>make uninstall</COMMAND> and
      then <COMMAND>make clean</COMMAND>- see 
      <FILENAME>INSTALL</FILENAME> file again here.</PARA>

    <PARA>For debugging purposes, you should pass the
      <LITERAL>-g</LITERAL> option to <COMMAND>configure</COMMAND>, to
      whit: <COMMAND>CFLAGS=-g ./configure &lt;the rest of your
      options&gt;</COMMAND> and leave the sources in the build or
      source tree. However, your applications will run faster if you
      compile with optimization, <COMMAND>CFLAGS=-O3
      -g</COMMAND>. This will make debugging inside the Swarm
      libraries strange, but gives noticeable performance improvement.
