	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add acprogs.m4.

	* acprogs.m4: Use AC_PATH_PROG instead of AC_CHECK_PROG.
	Check for gswin32c as well as gs (gswin32 will open
	a window during test).  Write to out$$.png instead of /dev/null, which 
	Win32 version of GhostScript doesn't know about.  
	Subsitute GS_LIB.
