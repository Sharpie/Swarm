	* swarm-doclet.jar: Regenerated.

	* ClassWriter.java (printAllMembers()): Add conditional to use
	non-standard, Swarm-specific doclet methods, only when we are at
	least two-deep in the class hierarchy, i.e. `swarm.Selector', will
	be treated as per the standard, but
	`swarm.defobj.LispArchiverImpl' will use the Swarm-specific
	formatting.

	* swarm-doclet.jar: Regenerated.

	* Makefile.am (JAVASOURCE): Generate names to all the Java source
	files.
	(NAMES): Source files, without the .java extension.
	(CLASSES): Generate the class names.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add $(JAVASOURCE).
	(MAINTAINTER_MODE): Add conditional rules to regenerate the
	swarm-doclet.jar file, only in maintainer-mode.
	($(CLASSES)): Rule for generating class files.
	($(srcdir)/swarm-doclet.jar): Run jar.
	(clean-local): Remove generated class and jar files.
	(all): Force regeneration if swarm-doclet.jar has changed.

	* ConfigurationStandard.java (noclassdetails, hide): Two new
	fields for command-line arguments to doclet, set both to false, by
	default.
	(setSpecificDocletOptions()): Set options.
	(specificDocletOptionLength()): Likewise for length.
	
	* AbstractSubWriter.java (printMembersSummary()): Only respect @hide
	directive if `-hide' command line has been set.
	(printMembers()): Likewise.
	
	* ClassWriter.java (printAllMembers()): Call
	MethodSubWriter.printImplementedMembersSummary, rather than the
	default printMembersSummary, when dealing with a class, to reduce
	the amount of redundant detailed method documentation.  If
	noclassdetail flag set, don't print detailed method information
	for classes.

	* MethodSubWriter.java (composeImplementedMethodMap()): New
	method. Make the underlying for the given interface.
	(getMethodMapForInterface()): New method. Use above, recursively
	search interfaces to generate the whole Map
	(printImplementedMembersInfo()): New method. Given a key in the
	member Map - keyed to interface name - generate the summary table,
	with links to the detailed *interface* documentation for the
	method, not the supressed detail for method in the class.
	(printImplementedMembersSummary()): New method.  Use above to
	generate the entire list of methods in class, with pointers to the
	which methods in the interfaces, which they implement.
