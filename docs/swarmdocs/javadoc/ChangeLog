	* Makefile.am (NAME): Set to `refbook-java'. Use throughout.
	(STUBS): Generate a list of generated stub directories and
	`package.html' file to make stub generation only happen on demand,
	not perfect, but better than forcing each run.
	($(STUBS)): New rule for actually generating the stubs, formerly
	`stubs'.
	(latex): New rule to generate a LaTeX version of the
	documentation.  Depend on $(NAME).tex and the
	latex/LatexDoclet.class file.
	(html): Depend on $(NAME)/index.html and html/swarm-doclet.jar.
	($(NAME)/index.html): Run javadoc here for html output. Create a
	$(NAME) subdirectory to place all the generated html from the
	javadoc run.  Depend on $(STUBS)
	($(NAME).tex): Likewise for LaTeX output.  Depend on $(STUBS)
	(MOSTLYCLEANFILES, clean-local): Macros for cleanup.
	(SUBDIRS): New subdirectories `html' and `latex' for the
	respective javadoc doclets.
