LatexDoclet
=========

LatexDoclet is a doclet for the JDK 1.2 javadoc program that
generates Latex format documetnation.  Latex is a type-setting
package based on the Tex system, and is available for virtually
all operating systems.

The complete documentation for this tool is in readme.dvi or
readme.pdf.  To read or print the dvi file, you need Latex installed.
To read or print the pdf file, you need Adobe Acrobat installed.

A good Windows version of Latex is the MikTex system, available from:

For the OS/2 operating system, try:

For other operating systems, you're on your own.  I've tested this
doclet against both the above systems, and it seems to work fine.
This doclet generates code conforming to the Latex2e specification.
