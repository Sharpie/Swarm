      <para>Swarm applications are distributed separately: you will
        need to download and unpack applications independently.
        Available here are the standard Objective C
        <application>swarmapps</application> package, as well Java
        translations of two well-known Swarm applications:
        <application>jmousetrap</application> and
        <application>jheatbugs</application>.</para>

  <para>Swarm applications are distributed separately: You will need
   to download and unpack applications independently.  You will next
   need to change the definition of the <envar>SWARMHOME</envar>
   environment variable to point to the location of your Swarm
   installation (typically <filename
    class="directory">/usr/local/</filename> or
   <filename>/usr/</filename> if you've installed it from a binary
   package on a GNU/Linux system).  All you need to do to compile an
   application is type <userinput>make</userinput>, and it will
   compile and link.</para>

  <para><ulink

   <application>template</application>,
   <application>heatbugs</application>,
   <application>mousetrap</application>,
   <application>market</application>,
   <application>tutorial</application>, and
   <application>hello-world</application>). (The version numbers on all
   the applications have been brought up to &VERSION; to coincide with
   the kernel release.  But, they may increment independently from the
   version of the kernel release.)</para>

  <para>Java applications can be run in the development environment
   of your choice.  You must ensure that the javaswarm DLL is in the
   <envar>PATH</envar> and that <filename>swarm.jar</filename> is
   available as a library (e.g. in the <envar>CLASSPATH</envar>).</para>
  
  <para>As of 2.0.1, Sun JDK 1.1, Sun JDK 1.2, and Kaffe are known
   to work.  Swarm 2.0.1 is known to work with JBuilder3 and Visual Caf&eacute;
   and <emphasis>not</emphasis> to work with Visual Age 2.</para>
  
  <para>For users that prefer or require a command line interface,
   we provide the scripts <filename>javaswarm</filename> and
   <filename>javacswarm</filename> for running and compiling Java
   Swarm applications, respectively.
