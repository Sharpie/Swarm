        <para>The Integrating Modelling Toolkit (IMT) is a generic,

          definition and use of interoperable XML-specified model
          components.  It is being developed by <ulink

        Modeling Language</ulink> (MAML)</title> 

        <para>The current version of MAML is basically an extension to
          Objective C (using the Swarm libraries). It consists of a
          couple of `macro-keywords' that define the general structure
          of a simulation. The remaining must be filled with pure
          swarm-code. A MAML-to-Swarm (named
          <application>xmc</application>) compiler is also being
          developed which compiles the source code into a swarm
          application. Like every other Swarm application, this
          generated application must be compiled by
          <application>gcc</application>.</para>

        <title><ulink url="http://www.omicrongroup.org/evo">Evo</ulink></title>
        <para> is a software development framework built on top of Swarm that
allows developers to build complex alife simulations.  Using Evo,
researchers can easily build systems of independent agents interacting
with one another and with their environment.  Evo implements
biological operators such as genetic recombination and mutation to
evolve the behavior of agents so that they are more adapted to their
environment.

Evo is similar to genetic programming (GP) in the sense that the genome
of an individual agent is a program that is executed. The Evo framework
handles the generation and execution of these genomes within the environment
specified by the developer.

Analysis tools allow the developer to see how the gene pool of a population
changes over time, and how individual agents are genetically related to
other agents in the population.  Evo includes several example simulations
to get developers started, as well as a comprehensive programmer's guide
and API reference.
