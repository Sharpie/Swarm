    The Swarm Development Group is pleased to announce SwarmFest 2001,
    the fifth annual meeting of the Swarm user group.  At SwarmFest
    2001, researchers from diverse disciplines get the opportunity to
    share their knowledge and experience with multi-agent modeling and
    the Swarm simulation system.  The Swarm Development Group also
    uses the meeting to help determine future development priorities,
    so come and tell us what's on your mind!  The meeting is a cross
    section of the community, historically including content suitable
    for both inexperienced and experienced users.
