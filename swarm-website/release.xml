    <title>Which version should I get?</title>

    <para>The development snapshot is the only release which we are
  currently actively maintaining, and is the only version that we make
  bugfixes in.  Swarm 2.1.1 was released on 10 April 2000, and is now
  over two years old.  It is recommended that for serious development
  most people should attempt to download and install the latest <link
  linkend="release-swarm-snapshot">development snapshot</link>.</para>

    <para>Casual users who simply want to test drive Swarm and the
  demo applications should probably install a <link
  linkend="release-packaged">stable binary
  package</link>.</para>

  <tip> <para>Swarm is divided into three main pieces: source,
   documentation, and applications.  They are each bestowed version
   numbers that are independently increased except for major releases
   of the source.  The version map right now is:

      <programlisting format="linespecific">source: &VERSION;
docs: &VERSION;
apps: &VERSION;
        heatbugs: &VERSION;
        template: &VERSION;
          market: &VERSION;
       mousetrap: &VERSION;
        tutorial: &VERSION;
     hello-world: &VERSION;</programlisting>
</para>
