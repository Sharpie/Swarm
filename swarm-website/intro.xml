  <para>Swarm is a software package for multi-agent simulation of
    complex systems, originally developed at the &SFI;. Swarm is
    intended to be a useful tool for researchers in a variety of
    disciplines. The basic architecture of Swarm is the simulation of
    collections of concurrently interacting agents: with this
    architecture, we can implement a large variety of agent based
    models.</para>

  <para>The Swarm software is available to the general public under
    <link linkend="release-license">GNU licensing terms</link>. Swarm
    is experimental software, which means that it's complete enough to
    be useful but will always be under development.</para>
