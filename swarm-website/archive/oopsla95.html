<h2>Abstract</h2>
For greater adaptability, a generic software abstraction can define a variety
of optional elements selectable by a client.  The elements required for a
particular case may be specified using ordinary object messages during a
restricted create phase of an object.  Following the create phase, a suitable
implementation of requested behavior can be selected or generated, using
mixtures of general-purpose and special-case code.  Generic abstractions with
selectable options are typically much simpler than direct support for every
possible combination of separate needs, both for clients requesting a
combination and for designs that implement them.<p>

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>

To the extent that current languages and frameworks support variability
in a software design, they typically assume that any selectable options are
locally and independently substitutable in the final design.  Type
parameterization is a typical example, in which the option substituted is a
type used to define another type.  More complex interpretation of options and
their combinations can typically be accomplished only by ad hoc techniques
such as macro processing or code generation.<p>

As an alternative to rigid mapping from client interface to implementation,
Lortz and Shin [1] have described a framework that permits explicit selection
of features needed by a client combined with automatic selection of partially
initialized classes to best implement a client request.  This paper briefly
describes an approach which is similar in overall outline, but which
adopts a more direct form of specification as ordinary object messages
followed by efficient procedural selection of a final implementation that
satisfies a request.<p>

Like the Lortz and Shin framework, this approach specifies a contract between
client and server code by variable settings of explicit contract terms.  The
approach differs in that customization of a generic service is incorporated
directly in the lifecycle of an object, using native message-passing both for
customization and for client access to the customized service.  The interface
to an object is divided into two distinct lifetime phases: an initial
create-time phase to constrain an open-ended set of available options, and a
finalized, remaining phase to provide requested behavior using a selected
implementation.  Transition between the phases is a versatile time at which
to adapt a realized implementation to client needs.<p>


<h2>II. Create-phase protocols in the Swarm System</h2>

The Swarm Simulation System is a general-purpose framework for simulating
concurrent, distributed artificial worlds [2].  It is being developed by the
artificial life group at the Santa Fe Institute to provide a general
architecture for problems in a wide variety of disciplines ranging from
physics to biology to economics.  The generality of Swarm requires that its
software components meet an unusually wide range of specific problem
requirements.  This generality applies both to the structure of objects or
agents belonging to a simulated world and to actions which occur on these
objects.<p>

Swarm software components are object abstractions coded in the Objective C
language, as implemented by the GNU C Compiler.  The GNU compiler implements
extended features of the Objective C language defined as part of NextStep [3].
These include the ability to declare message protocols available on objects
independent of any implementing classes.  Unlike the single inheritance
Objective C supports for classes, unrestricted multiple inheritance is
supported for protocols.  Ordinarily, protocols carry no implementation
information; they are used solely for documentation or for typing of remote
interfaces.<p>

Swarm has adapted the protocols of Objective C to define client interfaces
entirely independent of any implementing classes.  A phase division of the
client interface permits customizing the specific options which a particular
instance requires.  Given a customization, the library may select a suitable
implementation for requested options using a wide variety of techniques.  All
these implementations are entirely hidden from the client; the client sees
only an object that supports the message behavior defined by a protocol.<p>

Both the customization and the selection of implementation are accomplished
using standard message dispatching to abstraction-specific methods that
directly record and implement the permitted customization.  Each abstraction
can define specific messages available for customization, along with methods
that interpret this form of procedural specification language in an unusually
direct way.  The overhead of interpreting a string-based representation of
client requirements, along with generic forms of mapping from client requests
to available implementation (both part of the framework described by Lortz
and Shin) can be avoided in favor of a directly procedural approach.
Overheads of customization can be eliminated almost entirely by saving
results of customizations which are repeatedly instantiated.<p>

Because implementations may be selected for any combination of available
customization options, all the customization requests must be received before
any final implementation decision is made.  Pooling of customization
requirements is accomplished by supplying them during an initial phase of
instance creation during which required behavioral characteristics of the
client interface are established.  None of the final client behavior is
available until the initialization phase is complete.  The use of a distinct
phase for constraining an initial, generic object to final lock-in of
remaining behavior gives some of the concrete feel of a prototype-based
language.<p>

Special messages, createBegin and createEnd, are used to bracket messages
which set customization options.  Following is an example of such messages on
a simplified form of CellSpace object which implements the update rules of a
cellular automaton.<p>
<pre>
  aCA = [CellSpace createBegin];    // begin customization of a new instance
  [aCA setNumberOfDimensions: 2];   // set options...
  [aCA setGeometry: Rectangular];
  [aCA setXSize: 256 setYSize: 256];
  [aCA setNeighborhood: VonNeumann];
  [aCA setRuleTable: aTable];
  aCA = [aCA createEnd];            // reset object id to finalized instance

  [aCA displayOn: aDisplay];        // set up and use finalized instance
  while (1)
  {
    [aCA updateStep];
    [aCA redisplay];
  }
</pre>

An alternative to createBegin and createEnd messages is the use of
customizeBegin and customizeEnd messages around the same kinds of option-
setting messages.  Instead of returning a finalized instance, customizeEnd
returns a special object which needs only subsequent create messages to create
instances having the fully customized behavior.  The results of interpreting
client requests and selecting an implementation can all be cached in this
object, saving any further overhead.  Support of this alternate mode requires
no additional coding save for a single reflective operation in createEnd that
notes a final selected implementation prior to returning an sample instance.<p>

The object returned by createBegin need not have any resemblance in class or
implementation to the object returned by createEnd.  The initial customization
object need only have the ability to save the various customization requests
(out of an open-ended list of optional settings) in local instance variables
or elsewhere for later access by createEnd.  createEnd checks all the requests
for consistency and completeness (typically implementing its own rules for
defaults), selects an implementation, and finally allocates and initializes a
finalized instance of some implementation class which it returns.<p>

createEnd may use many different techniques to implement requested options,
varying across a wide range of interpretation and selection costs vs.
finalized efficiency.  In some cases, createBegin may have already allocated a
usable form of final instance, so that createEnd need only perform finalized
settings of instance variables and dispatchable methods before returning.  In
other cases, createEnd may simply clone an already initialized example
instance, or else allocate a new instance of some predefined implementation
class.  Depending on the options, it may allocate either a highly customized
class tuned for a specific combination of options, or a generic class which
varies its behavior according to local variable settings.  In extreme cases,
it could even custom-generate a version of code optimized for the specific
needs at hand.<p>

Option settings may include not only compile-time constants, but specific
related instances which the new instance depends on or cooperates within some
way.  (In the example above, the rule table object supplies static or dynamic
update rules.)  The unit of optimization can expand beyond individual
instances to organizations and assemblies of cooperating instances.  Binding
of instances into specific organizations reflects the way adaptation occurs in
many systems other than software.  Software adaptation needs to take advantage
of every proven technique of evolution and adaptation that can be adapted to
its own domain.<p>

<h3>Question for workshop (requested of attendees):</h3>

To what extent does the wider coverage of adaptive software require that
implementations be dynamically generated or customized to meet specific
requirements of a case-at-hand?<p>
