<h2>I. Swarm Overview</h2>

Swarm is a general-purpose package for simulating concurrent,
distributed artificial worlds.  It is being developed by the artificial
life group at the Santa Fe Institute to provide a general architecture
for problems that arise in a wide variety of disciplines ranging from
physics to biology to economics.  Many of these problems possess a
common structure that consists of large numbers of autonomous agents
interacting in the context of some environment.  Computer simulation is
an essential tool to study the global and adaptive behavior that can
emerge in such complex systems.<p>

The goal of Swarm is to reduce the work required by researchers to
build and simulate an artificial world, and to provide standardized
tools for configuring, running, and analyzing results from a
simulation.  The core of Swarm is an object-oriented framework for
defining the behavior of agents and other objects that interact during
a simulation.  Objects of Swarm are organized into a hierarchy of
subswarms that may be allocated across multiple processor and
communications boundaries.  Each swarm is responsible for managing all
memory and processing resources required by its objects.  Each swarm
maintains a schedule for simulating a continuous cycle of activity
within its objects.<p>

<h2>II. Swarm as a Model of Computing</h2>

By simulating the concurrent processes that occur in some real or
artificial world, Swarm is especially well suited for studying processes 
of computation that occur in nature.  Computation in nature is inherently
parallel and distributed across large numbers of independently acting
elements.  Combination of parallel behavior, even when individual
components follow only simple rules, can result in sophisticated
abilities of learning, adaptation, and dynamic response.<p>


Parallel computation in nature sets a high standard of robustness and
flexibility for deliberately engineered software to emulate.  Current
hardware and software is still too crude to match either the degree of
parallelism in nature or the flexibility of its control over
distributed processes.  Nevertheless, examples from nature can suggest
important principles for software design.  Software architecture can
adopt a flexible composition of complex behavior out of simpler
components operating in parallel.  Moreover, an object engine to
simulate the parallel computation of nature would seem to include all
other forms of computation as special cases.  (Any computation to be
performed has itself arisen within nature.)<p>

<h2>III. Swarm as a Concurrent Object Engine</h2>

Swarm is a framework for simulating processes that occur across large
numbers of concurrently interacting agents.  Agents interact directly
with each other and with other objects representing the structure of an
environment.  In principle, all agents act concurrently and
autonomously: the abstract model of Swarm is a concurrent object
system in which all objects can be continuously active.<p>

The principal task of Swarm is to provide a mapping of its abstract
model to various classes of available computing machinery.  Most
available machines cannot provide the number of independent processors
which would be required to represent each agent directly by its own
processor.  Swarm simulations are expected to scale to many thousands
of agents interacting over many thousands of cycles of agent
lifetimes.  Target machines for Swarm range from a single sequential
processor to multiple processors on a network to massively parallel
machines having hundreds or thousands of processors.<p>

To target such a diverse range of execution platforms, Swarm defines an
intermediate level of virtual processing machinery.  This machinery
consists of a hierarchical structure of swarms and subswarms.  Each
swarm is a collection of agents and associated objects which execute
on their own virtual processor.  Each swarm includes a schedule
of pending actions for its agents to perform.  The entire task of the
virtual processor is to traverse this schedule and to call these
actions when the indicated time has arrived.  The schedule is an
explicit and modifiable component of the swarm which agents can revise
as they perform their actions.<p>

In principle, all virtual processors run asynchronously with respect to
each other, though this may not actually be the case on a particular
real machine.  Within a swarm, however, all actions are defined to
occur in strict succession along a single linear dimension of time,
with the one exception that multiple actions can be defined to
occur at precisely the same point in time.  (If the only real processor
is sequential, these actions would still need to be performed in some
particular sequence, but such a physical execution sequence is not to be
regarded as significant within the model.)<p>

Actions in more than one swarm can be linked so that they are also to
be regarded as occurring at the same point in time.  Cross-swarm
interactions must be mediated by a containing swarm that establishes a
common timeline.  Ultimately, all actions may be regarded as occurring
in a tree of branching synchronization timelines.  Each timeline
represents a synchronization of all scheduled activity within a cluster
of closely related agents.  Only at occasional intervals are these
local timelines joined with each other at actions that synchronize
across larger groupings of agents.<p>

No facilities for asynchronous communication are built into the basic
Swarm kernel.  Asynchronous communication must be supplied by explicit
agents that implement a succession of message acceptance and delivery
events.  In basing its concurrency entirely on a model of strict
synchronous interaction, the Swarm model departs notably from
concurrent object systems that follow the Actor model of distributed
computing [1].  The Actor model is based on asynchronous message passing,
which it motivates by the spatial distribution and independent
execution rates of objects [2].  Swarm, however, undertakes to model
any level of behavior of possible interest, which includes basic
physical and spatial processes in which interaction is synchronous.
Assuming a discrete model of space and time (required by digital
computation in any case), asynchronous behavior must ultimately be
definable in terms of atomic events distributed in space and time.
Within the discrete approximation of time adopted by a model, such
events occur at the same time to any agents participating in them.<p>

As a practical concern in building a computer simulation, it can be
difficult to arrange the amount of synchronization required for
extensive amounts of direct interaction.  Such limits on the extent of
direct interaction, however, directly reflect similar limits that exist
in nature.  Coarse-grained agents distributed in space and time can
ordinarily affect only a small set of other agents to which they are
somehow directly connected or otherwise adjacent.  Special agents, such
as communication networks and message delivery systems, are often
deliberately devised to enable networks of denser connection, or to
mediate interactions separated in time.  Swarm requires that these
mediator agents themselves be represented explicitly in the simulation.<p>

With respect to other object systems, probably the most distinctive
feature of Swarm is its definition of an explicit linear time shared by
all agents belonging to a swarm.  The current time and the schedule of
actions to be performed at future times are fully accessible for
examination and/or modification by the agents.  In its model of time,
Swarm is much more closely related to discrete event simulation systems
than to concurrent object systems based on asynchronous message
passing.  Unlike most discrete event systems, however, Swarm localizes
each time to a cluster of related agents, and requires that this local
time be synchronized with more global time only at specific scheduled
intervals.<p>
