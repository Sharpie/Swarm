   <citetitle>Particle Economics Research Institute: the PartEcon Model</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>Particle economics describes a model and a methodology for
     generating emergent economic behavior driven by the creation of
     new modes of economic activity.  An abstract agent-based model of
     generation of <quote>products</quote> from <quote>input
     objects</quote> provides the basic structure.  These
     <quote>creation nodes</quote> also keep track of their activities
     using the discipline of double-entry bookkeeping, monitoring
     continuously what they traded to whom, when, and for how much (of
     other products).  This knowledge is used to update their beliefs
     about the values of products and the risk associated with
     transactions.  There is no universally accepted
     <quote>money</quote> to begin with.  Nodes must decide how to
     measure their fitness as they make their way in their context of
     other nodes.  This optimization of fitness as well as measure of
     fitness eventually leads to the emergence of money.  In addition,
     the influx of new modes of economic activity generates
     Schumpeterian cascades of creation and extinction of whole
     communities of modes of economic activity.  These cascades are
     described both in extent and time by power laws.</para>

   <citetitle>Can Agent-based Modeling Contribute to Scientific Theory?</citetitle>
   <abstract>
    <para> Scientists that use agent-based models (ABMs) are often
     asked how their simulations can contribute to <quote>theory</quote>. ABM
     simulations are sometimes viewed as too specific and
     parameter-dependent to lead to general theory. We will lead a
     discussion of such questions as: (1) What is
     <quote>theory</quote> in the context of ABM simulation and how
     does it differ from classical theory? and (2) How can ABMs be
     used to develop theory?  Examples from social and ecological
     sciences will be used to illustrate the discussion. In ecology,
     classical theory generally consists of equations assumed to
     represent system-level behaviors. In social sciences, theory
     often addresses how individuals interact. With ABMs, we start
     with the fundamental assumption that system-level behaviors
     emerge from the traits of individual agents and their
     environment. <quote>Theory</quote> in the ABM context consists of
     models of agent traits: how agents interact with each other and
     their environment to produce emergent system properties. These
     models of agent traits may be specific to certain circumstances
     and agent types, or they may be quite general and widely
     useful. A key advantage of theory in an ABM context is that
     ABM-based theory is readily tested: ABMs can be used in a variety
     of ways to test the accuracy and generality of models of agent
     traits.</para> </abstract></bibliomixed>

   <citetitle>Improved Java Virtual Enterprise (jVE) in Swarm</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>This is an improved version of the agent based enterprise
     simulator that was already introduced during the 2001 SwarmFest.
     Our simulated enterprise has both orders to accomplish -
     described by <quote>recipes</quote> that contain what to do - and
     units that perform the different steps of production. Units can
     be within the firm or outside, constituting other complex
     enterprises or standing alone as small business actors.
    </para>
    
    <para>The core of the model is now the clear separation between WD
     and DW, i.e.  between the order recipes (WD: What to Do) and the
     operating units (DW: which is Doing What).  WD and DW are
     completely independent, in formalism and in code. So, running the
     model, we can check the consistency of the two sides, as in the
     actual world, where the output of an enterprise arises from a
     complex interaction among products and production tools.
    </para>
    
    <para>Recipes now deal with internal parallel production paths and
     include assembly steps, where the typical just in time problem of
     a supply chain can be tested.  With the model we present five
     agent based simulations applied to enterprises. Finally, the
     theoretical goal of the research is illustrated: the reproduction
     of the trial and error process that generates new enterprises.

   <citetitle>Classifier Systems in Swarm: a general purpose software.</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>Classifier systems are often used in AB models because they
     produce rules very closed to the problem and easy
     understandable. A matter in using CS is that the computation of
     the reward each rule has to be given may act dramatically on the
     learning capability of the method. Starting from the CW package I
     wrote in 1999 to handle CS, I've produced CW2 that includes
     optional features to handle rewards in a general way. CW2 removes
     the problem of reward computation and allows usage of both
     negative or positive amounts as well.
    </para>

    <para>CW2 has been used in several models, two of them will be
     showed: the anteater and the Bertrand's oligopoly. In the first
     model a CS is used by an anteater to guess the behaviour of
     Langton's ants and eat them. Only observing ant's moves the CS
     reproduces the whole ant's rule set. In Bertrand's oligopoly the
     interplay between two enterprises is performed. Starting without
     any initial knowledge of the market players use own CS to make
     price-strategy, rules are evaluated by simply giving the
     profit/loss amount as reward. After learning the Nash's
     equilibrium is reached.

   <citetitle>The Beer Dock: Three and a Half Implementations of the
    Beer Distribution Game</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>The Beer Distribution Game is a classic supply chain
    problem widely used in graduate business programs to teach the
    concepts of supply chain management (Moseklide, Larsen, and
    Sterman, 1991).  It is well suited for this purpose since it is
    simple enough to be easily understandable but complex enough to be
    interesting.  In particular, the Beer Distribution Game is notable
    for its ability to confound typical human players (Sterman, 1987,
    1989).  Many people who play the game find it difficult, if not
    impossible, to avoid the chaotic operating regimes that are the
    game's hallmark.</para>

    <para>Docking or alignment is a verification process that seeks
     to find isomorphic relations between two or more implementations of
     an underlying model.  Docking or alignment are used to "determine
     whether two models can produce the same results, which in turn is
     the basis for critical experiments and for tests of whether one
     model can subsume another" (Axtell, Axelrod, Epstein, and Cohen,
     1996).</para>

    <para>The original Beer Distribution Game was implemented as a
     systems dynamics model.  The authors have implemented the game using
     Mathematica functional programming, RePast agent-based modeling and
     simulation (ABMS), and Swarm ABMS.  The authors have reproduced all
     the published results with these new implementations.  As part of this
     process, the authors have docked the implementations.  The docking
     process was found to be challenging and time consuming, but ultimately
     rewarding.  Several common themes of potential value to other
     researchers arose during the model docking process.</para>

   <citetitle><ulink url="http://math.humboldt.edu/~simsys/">More
     Fishy Business: Using Swarm Models to Test Theories of Fish
     Ecology</ulink></citetitle>

   <abstract>

    <para>Three recent studies used Swarm models to test theoretical
     assumptions of fish ecology. The first two studies used an
     agent-based model (ABM) that simulates how stream trout select
     their habitat considering how mortality risks, growth potential,
     and competition with other trout varies among locations. (1)
     Field studies show that when densities of juvenile trout are
     high, the average trout size is lower. These studies are used to
     support the theory of density-dependent growth: higher densities
     of fish produce more competition for food and therefore lower
     growth. Our ABM reproduced the observed decrease in fish size as
     density increased, but also found that growth rates were higher,
     not lower, when density was high. The decrease in fish size
     apparently was due to factors other than food competition, for
     example increasing rates of mortality in larger fish. (2) The
     models most commonly used to manage fish and wildlife habitat are
     based on the assumption that the habitat where animals are most
     commonly observed is the highest quality habitat.  In the trout
     ABM, we know the intrinsic quality of each habitat patch and
     compared it to the number of fish using each patch in
     simulations.  Even though fish in the ABM select the best
     available patch, our results contradict the assumption that the
     most commonly used habitat is the highest quality habitat. (3)
     Ocean herring migrate in large schools that have been observed to
     drastically shift destinations in years when the number of
     <quote>experienced</quote> migrants is low compared to the number
     of juvenile herring that have never migrated before. Research
     shows that a fish school can be considered a self-organized
     aggregation of individuals following rules similar to those of
     Craig Reynolds' famous <quote>Boids</quote> model. We used an ABM
     similar to Boids to test the theory that the
     <quote>experienced</quote> migrants can control the direction of
     the fish school only if they are a sufficient fraction of the
     fish in the school. We found a sharp threshold in the ability of
     experienced fish to control school migration: as their fraction
     increased from 4% to 7% of the total, their control went from
     none to complete. These studies contribute to the debate over
     which is fishier: ABMs or conventional ecological theories.

   <citetitle>SMS: A Spinning Mill Simulator</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para> Production planning is a problem common to many industries:
     a timely delivery is often at odds with other technical and
     economical constraints.</para>

    <para> In many cases even short period planning may be a big deal,
     even for medium to small-sized plants: it is not uncommon that
     many lots with different technical specs are to be interleaved in
     the production plan. Production units then need to be fine-tuned
     accordingly. Finding the most appropriate sequence is an
     astounding task, involving a huge number of combinations, which
     is nowadays performed by experience and common sense, essentially
     by hand.  SMS tries to automatically sort out the best sequence
     combining a 1:1 model of a firm's supply chain (able to evaluate
     each solution's <quote>fitness</quote>) with a genetic algorithm
     (G. Ferraris' Genetic Manipulator v.0.2), both built in Swarm,
     which, instead of attempting a brute force approach bound to
     fail, searches the solutions' space in a clever way, often
     converging to a good solution in a matter of minutes on standard
     equipment.</para>

   <citetitle>Recent Developments in Repast</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>
     In addition to producing regular updates of our current
     behaviors, we have spent the past months developing the Recursive
     Porous Agent Simulation Toolkit (Repast) to include several new
     tools.
     
     One of the most significant change we have made to Repast's
     network support has been to restructure its approach to network
     visualization. In order to provide a more accurate view of social
     networks as they change, we have integrated network visualization
     techniques used in full-fledged network analysis packages, such
     as Pajak and Ucinet, into Repast.</para>

     <para>We have also begun to integrate Geographical Information
     Systems (GIS) technologies into the Repast framework. At present,
     Repast has limited support for raster images. We intend to
     address this limitation by including vector type maps in the next
     release of Repast. The GIS support will include both
     visualization as well as limited geostatistical analysis
     capabilities.</para>

     <para>Finally, we have released SimBuilder, a Rapid Application
     Development too, in beta form. At present SimBuilder only
     supports developing network models, but we are working to expand
     it to include spatial models as well. We have included NQPy, a
     Python-like development language, to simplify the development of
     models.

   <citetitle>Potential Of Ant Colony Optimization To Satellite Image
    Classification</citetitle>

   <abstract>

    <para>Studies on the behavior of social insects such as ants have
     shown that they exhibit a collective intelligence that cannot be
     explained based on the actions of the individuals that compose
     the colony. In an ant colony, global or emergent patterns emerge
     due to the local interactions of the ants. This ability to
     generate global patterns by a swarm of ants has served as the
     basis for the development of a set of algorithms that emphasize
     distributedness, robustness and flexibility - Ant Colony
     Optimization (ACO) Algorithms. Ant Colony Optimization techniques
     have been used to solve a number of network problems such as the
     Travelling Salesman's Problem and the Job Scheduling
     Problem. Vitorino Ramos and Filipe Almeida have shown that ACO
     algorithms could also be developed to solve the problem of image
     segmentation. This development is of immense use to researchers
     in the field of image classification and pattern recognition who
     have of late concentrated on developing robust, autonomous and
     flexible algorithms that can delineate the classes with minimum
     or zero inputs from the user. The ACO algorithms' potential for
     image classification has not been fully investigated so far. The
     purpose of this work is therefore to determine if ACO algorithms
     can be successfully applied to the problem of image
     classification of satellite imagery.</para>

   <citetitle>A decision algorithm with memory and learning</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>In game theory, a player selects between alternative
     opportunities to obtain the best outcome.  This process requires
     that the player has knowledge of the opportunities, their values
     or rewards, the probabilities of obtaining the rewards, and the
     cost of playing.  In early decision theories, players have this
     knowledge a priori.  For example, in marginal foraging theory an
     animal leaves a patch when the consumption rate declines to the
     average over all patches.  However, in agent-based models, we
     prefer agents not be endowed with omniscience.  Here I explore
     the properties of a simple model in which an agent learns through
     encounters or events, imperfectly remembers what it learns, and
     makes decisions by considering past and recent events.  I explore
     a three-parameter version of the model with a player that
     continually decides between two states that present different,
     random patterns of opportunities.  Under a wide range of
     parameters the player first explores both states and then settles
     into an optimum decision pattern.  However, under other ranges of
     parameters, the player continually switches states, resulting in
     a suboptimum behavior.  I conclude that the model, with its game
     and learning theory foundations, and its simplicity, may have
     wide application in agent based models.  It is currently being
     applied to fish foraging (Anderson, 2002) and terrorist behavior
     (Silverman 2001).</para>

   <citetitle><remark>Yet to be submitted...</remark></citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>
     <remark> If it's not too forward, I could give a presentation on
     two things: (1) creating custom user interfaces for working with
     swarm using Tcl/Tk, and (2) creating Zoomable heirarchical models
     using Pad++ inside Swarm.  (1) might be of interest simply
     because I get the feeling (perhaps incorrectly) that many Swarm
     users just rely on the default Control Panel and Probe displays,
     and it's not too hard to create a more polished &amp;
     professional looking model with a bit of Tcl/Tk integration.  (2)
     might be of interest because it just looks really, really cool.
     I've posted a movie of one proof-of-concept model at
     http://evolve.lse.ac.uk/jalex/misc/pad-swarm.gif.  (View from a
     fast computer, though, because it's over 8 Mb in size.  Also a
     bit jerky because my computer had a hard time capturing the video
     in real-time.)</remark></para>

    <para> <remark>The zoomable model was created by importing the
     Pad++ interface by calling [globalTkInterp eval: "load
     libpad.so"] in the model, which loaded all of the relevant Pad++
     features, and then doing some more Tcl/Tk coding.  Note that all
     rotational animations were triggered via the Swarm scheduler!

   <citetitle>A Computational Environment for Evaluating the
    Interaction of Grazing Animals and Landscapes</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>Ecosystem diversity is largely a result of the complex,
     non-linear interactions of the constituent members and
     communities that make up the ecosystem. One example of these
     interactions is between grazing animals and the plants that they
     graze on. Herbivores select plants based on real or perceived
     needs for calories, proteins, vitamins, minerals, or any other
     part of a well-balanced diet. The cues for herbivore grazing
     behavior is largely a result of post-ingestive feedback, which in
     turn is dependent on chemical reactions within the gut based on
     recent diet. The grazing behavior in turn affects the composition
     of plant communities in ways that may not be directly predictable
     from short-term observation, through selective cropping,
     trampling, seed transport, etc. Plants and grazers adapt over
     time in ways that either foster or discourage interaction,
     eliciting counter-adaptations in a cycle that can produce very
     complex webs of dependencies. Modeling such a system is
     complicated by the multiple feedbacks, and disparity of temporal
     and spatial scales of processes. A computational environment that
     addresses these issues can be constructed using principles of
     agent-based modeling, cellular automata, and artificial life. An
     example of such a computational environment is presented here.

   <citetitle>Modularity and Robustness in Organizations</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>Manufacturing cells (modules) represent a possible new
     organizational form that shares analogies but also differences
     with past organizational solutions.  Modules emerge at macro
     level as units performing manufacturing and non manufacturing
     activities; a micro level module combines different resources in
     a permanent way. The implications of a <quote>modular
     organization</quote> are several: large organizations emulate and
     reinterpret market's mechanisms and the principles of
     near-decomposability and self-organization.</para>

    <para>The aim of the model is to test different organizational
     structures against a given environment.  An organization has the
     ability to process information from the environment and diffuses
     the results within the organization. It is structured as an
     hierarchy, every element of the organization has finite
     computation capabilities and the ability to adapt his behavior
     accordingly to a feedback signal.  A modular organization is
     characterized by the level of redundancy i.e. by the number of
     duplicated and overlapped tasks. I have been studing the effect
     of environmental structural change on the behavior and
     performance of the firm.

   <citetitle>VSB 2.0: Visual Swarm Builder</citetitle>

   <abstract>

    <para>This is an improved version of the Visual Swarm Builder
     that was already introduced during the 2001 SwarmFest.  This is
     the new version and the first publicly available.</para>

    <para>The need of a common language for agent-based economic
     simulations is, by now, widely recognized and several attempts
     are currently underway to identify the fundamental
     characteristics that such language should have.  Between the two
     extremes of <quote>just add water</quote> and <quote>do it
     yourself</quote> several options have emerged in the last few
     years. Swarm, Ascape, Repast, Starlogo, AgentSheets and few other
     simulation platforms are, as of today, the most credible
     contenders.</para>

<!--
    <para>From the on-going discussion, a new trade-off has
     emerged. It is not anymore a matter of deciding whether the
     researcher should be constrained by the rules of an
     omni-comprehensive software environment (the "just-add-water"
     option) or, rather s/he should painstakingly construct every
     soft-brick of the artificial world modeled (the "do-it-yourself"
     alternative). Rather, the trade-off is between the ease of
     programming on the one hand, and the sophistication of the
     obtainable end-product.  Swarm in particular has attracted
     substantial interest from the economic profession (see for
     example Luna and Stefansson 2000), but is now challenged by
     simulation platforms like Ascape and Starlogo which are proposed
     as more "user-friendly" reducing the initial investment for the
     professional economist (but amateur programmer).
    </para>

    <para>Seldom in the economic history of the introduction of
     innovations, the adoption of a particular new technology over a
     contender has been dictated by the ascertained superiority. More
     often other factors like network effects and hysteresis played a
     more fundamental role.</para>

    <para>In a decentralized fashion-typical of the GNU philosophy
     which has inspired the design and diffusion of Swarm-several
     researchers have worked to make Swarm meet the challenges
     launched by other contenders to the role of esperanto of
     agent-based simulations.</para>
    -->

    <para>VSB represents one of the most straightforward and most
     rewarding ways to program the Simulations using Swarm
     Libraries. With very little effort, you can be right up to speed
     developing your next great simulation, without all that tedious
     mucking about worrying about the standard Swarm code.
    </para>
    
    <para>VSB is an integrated environment for the design and
     realization of Swarm code based on a menu driven selection of
     objects like schedule of events, graphics, lists and arrays etc.
     A visual building tool is clearly a useful extension to any
     programming environment, the more so for a large, complex and
     powerful simulation platform like Swarm. The absolute beginner as
     well as the expert programmer will find VSB useful. Because of
     its ease of use the former, and thanks to the speed with which a
     prototype can be obtained, the latter.</para>

   <citetitle>gpSwarm: Java Genetic Programming using the Swarm libraries</citetitle>

    <abstract>

    <para>This paper aims to present a new tool, called
     <quote>gpSwarm</quote>. for making Genetic Programming (GP). GP
     is a computational technique aiming to generate computer programs
     able to solve problems without being explicitly programmed for
     them and it belongs to a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence
     that studies topics related to machine learning.  gpSwarm is
     based on Java and on the Swarm libraries: it uses Swarm for
     managing the evolution algorithm and it uses Java as the language
     of possible solutions. gpSwarm is characterised by some
     advantages in comparison with other tools, mainly the opportunity
     to use different kinds of variables and the easy management of
     solutions space. Finally some examples are presented,
     illustrating how to use the tool and how to integrate it with
     Agent Based Models.</para>

   <citetitle><ulink
   url="http://cc.usu.edu/~slk1r/technology/swarmfest2002.html">Experimental
   Spatial Economics</ulink></citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para> The consideration of geographical or spatial factors on
     economics is not a new trend. Many of those conventional
     approaches have tried to explain this relationship as a linear
     process, partly because of the difficulty to deal with its
     complexity and because of the lack of experimental tools. Under
     the hypothesis of non-linear process, however, the degree of the
     direct dependence of an economical entity (agent) on spatial
     factors is less than what is explained in linear
     process. Instead, an agent acts more in harmony with what other
     agents are doing in a common space. In the complex system of the
     real world, the initial influence of spatial factors on the
     determination of the economic activities is very trivial. But as
     time passes, this trivial influence will indirectly accumulate in
     the way that is called positive feedbacks or increasing
     returns. Thusly, it <quote>seems</quote> that spatial factors
     solely have great magnetism in economics, while it is actually
     the entire system that is playing more important roles. By
     observing agent-based model, we can know in detail how a minor
     change in economic niche can greatly affect the spatial patterns
     through positive feedbacks. This paper introduces the concept of
     geographical selection that is perceived in non-linear process,
     with the cellular automata (cell automaton) simulation model
     based on the Swarm development environment. The result shows that
     the tendency of spatial distribution of industry gets
     strengthened over time through the positive feedbacks, all other
     things being equal.</para>

   <citetitle>Using Java and Swarm to Build a Stochastic Simulation of
    Natural Organic Matter (NOM) and Microbe Interactions in the
    Soil</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>Natural organic matter (NOM) is a heterogeneous mixture of
     organic molecules found in terrestrial and aquatic environments-
     from forest soils and streams to coastal rivers and marshes to
     the open ocean.  NOM plays a vital role in ecological and
     biogeochemical processes, including chemical buffering, mineral
     dissolution/precipitation, photochemistry, and microbial
     nutrition.  The production of NOM from biological precursor
     compounds and its remineralization into CO2 are closely linked
     both to ecosystem function and to the global carbon cycle.  No
     current models of NOM production and evolution, nor its
     interaction with microbes, describe both the quantitative aspects
     of organic carbon transfer and the qualitative aspects of NOM
     structural and functional heterogeneity.</para>

    <para>We are partially funded on this project by a NSF ITR grant
     and are designing and implementing a stochastic simulation of NOM
     production and evolution using Java and Swarm. A preliminary
     design and prototype will be described. This is a joint project
     involving Stephen Cabaniss- Kent State University, Department of
     Chemistry, and Patricia Maurice- University of Notre Dame,

   <citetitle>Top down and bottom up dynamic scheduling in Swarm: a
   comparison of implementations.</citetitle>

   <abstract>
    <para>The objective is to demonstrate the scheduling mechanisms
     available in Swarm and validate the implementation of models with
     decentralized, autonomous agent behavior.  The example model in
     which these designs are investigated concerns public opinion
     dynamics and social networks.  The model explores variants of
     Robert Axelrod's <quote>culture model</quote>.</para>

    <para>While all Swarm models are agent-based models, some models
     will orchestrate their actions from high level objects while
     others will allow the agents to <quote>schedule
     themselves</quote> in a decentralized way.  The Swarm class is
     vital because it controls the sequence of actions in the model.
     Swarms can be created at several levels so that the actions they
     imply are nested.  Roughly speaking, there are two designs for
     agent-based simulation models. First, programs can be designed
     with <quote>top down</quote>schedules, setups in which a higher
     level Swarm tells each agent to move (take a step).  This
     approach is useful for traditional models of cellular automata,
     such as the Game of Life.  These models can repeatedly iterate
     through the list of agents, either in a fixed or random order.
     The models are supposed to represent <quote>bottom up</quote>
     processes, such as emergent properties, but the schedules
     themselves are imposed from the top.  Some Swarm models that
     feature dynamic scheduling employ a variant of this top-down
     approach.  Second, the design might be decentralized and
     dynamic. This is scheduling from the <quote>bottom
     up</quote>. Each individual agent has its own scheduling
     apparatus.  Each agent decides individually when it wants to act.
     This is especially meaningful if time is thought of as a series
     of days or years, each of which is composed of smaller time
     steps.  The Swarm Activity library is designed to merge these
     individual actions into the overall time framework in a
     meaningful way.  If agents schedule themselves to act at the same
     time, their actions can be executed in a first-come/first-serve
     manner or in a randomly sorted order.</para>

<!-- <para>In this example batch of code, each agent represents a
    person who has an array of discrete-valued opinions.  The agents
    <quote>wander</quote> about, looking for other agents that they
    can interact with. C preprocessor flags are used to control which
    scheduling mechanism is used in a given build. The <quote>top
    down</quote> schedule approach creates a single schedule and it
    periodically instructs agents to plan their interactions and add
    them to the <quote>master schedule</quote>.  The <quote>bottom
    up</quote> model creates each individual agent from the Swarm
    class.  Each agent has a schedule, and it places its own actions
    into that schedule.  At the beginning of each day, agents plan
    their actions, and the last action they plan is a <quote>wake
    up</quote> call which will prompt them to repeat the cycle.  It is
    then the responsibility of the Swarm library to make sure that the
    autonomous actions of the agents are executed in a meaningful
    sequence.</para>

    <para>A comparison of the runs under the two setups allows us to
     validate the scheduling machinery included in the Swarm
     libraries.  Across 500 runs of the model, the histograms showing
     the number of iterations to convergence and the average level of
     perceived homogeneity are extremely similar.  All other summary
     measures for the models also support the contention that the
     decentralized scheduling of Swarm generates the intended sequence
     of actions.</para>
