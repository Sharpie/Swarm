  <para> As we implement and debug Swarm we write sample applications
    to test our ideas and our software. These applications also make
    good demos of Swarm, as they tend to show off the best features of
    our tool. We've written up a few of our demos as Web pages. The
    images you see here are actual snapshots from running Swarm
    demonstrations, they were being produced on the fly while the
    system ran.</para>
