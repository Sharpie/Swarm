      <para>We're trying to gather all the publications related to
          Swarm in a bibliographic database. <emphasis>Please do send
          us your references!</emphasis> E-mail them to
          <email>swarm@swarm.org</email>.</para>

  <para>Here we've collected as many citations to research using Swarm
    (either explicitly or implicitly) that we know about.  Please let
    us know if you have a paper by e-mailing:
    <email>swarm@swarm.org</email>.  There's also a list of references
    to Swarm in the general media, that may also be of
    interest. </para>

  <para>The previous generation of this database used
    <application>BibTeX</application>, but we have now moved to the
    <application>DocBook</application> XML/SGML format. Here is the
    <ulink url="biblio/pubs-biblio.xml">database</ulink>.  The
    database is also available in a printed format, as detailed
    below.</para>
