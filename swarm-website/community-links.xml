          MAGs search for the food, must move to the food, burn energy
          to make movements and to survive, grow as they eat and split
          in two as they reach reproduction size. Each agent has its
          genetic code determining food he consume and food he produce
          and some of its other abilities. The code is also subject of
          mutation to enable agents adaptation by evolution. Resources
          flux through the system is also controlled. Monitored
          parameters are overall population, agents qualities,
          resources amount and 2D world view itself.

                 Rob Kewley,</ulink> U.S.  Army.  Fuzzy-genetic
                 decision optimization solved a problem of positioning
                 military combat units for optimum performance.  It
                 used a Swarm simulation model to evaluate solutions,
                 a fuzzy logic module to map simulation outputs to a
                 single fitness value, and a genetic algorithm to
                 search the terrain for a near-optimal combination of
                 unit positions. In this study, the fuzzy-genetic
