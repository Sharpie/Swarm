  <para>This collection of pages is built from a single XML document
    using Norman Walsh's <ulink
    url="http://nwalsh.com/website">Website doctype</ulink> (a
    customization of the OASIS DocBook XML 4.0 DTD).  It is converted
    to HTML for the web using an <ulink
    url="http://nwalsh.com/website/xsl">XSLT stylesheet</ulink> (which
    is a customization of the <ulink
    url="http://nwalsh.com/docbook/xsl">XSL DocBook
    Stylesheets</ulink>).</para>

    <title>Why?</title>
    <para>There are a number of compelling reasons to maintain these pages in
      XML rather than HTML.</para>

    <orderedlist>

      <listitem><para>The navigation buttons and hierarchy of the
          website is automatically generated from the XML nesting
          structure, without needing to manually create navigation
          links.  In other words, a new level to the menus is
          generated every time a new webpage is nested inside
          another.</para>
      </listitem> 

      <listitem><para>Traditional printed documents are desirable for
          several of these pages.</para> <para>Using a more
          structurally rich format to represent the documents makes it
          possible to produce print as well as online versions.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>

        <para>All of the intra-document linking is
          automatic.</para> 

        <para>The XML system provides validation
        for the intra-document links, so there is no danger of broken
        links. (Links to external pages still have to be validated by
        an external program.)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Migrating these pages to future versions of HTML
          or other XML DTDs will only require new or updated style
          sheets.  No pages will have to be recoded, and the pages
          will conform to whatever output format is required, with no
          possibility of random human error.</para>
