Installation
------------

Place the files in this distribution somewhere on your machine.

Use
---

Process your Website documents with one of the following stylesheets
using your favorite XSLT processor:

  website.xsl   produces a flat-text website
  tabular.xsl   produces a tabular website with navigation in the
                left-hand column and page contents in the right-hand
                column.

    Both of these stylesheets produce a monolithic file that must be
    chunked. The chunk control files and libraries included in this
    distribution simplify this process, if you are using the chunk.pl
    file included in the DocBook XSL Stylesheet distribution.

  xtwebsite.xsl produces a flat-text website, chunked by XT
  xttabular.xsl produces a tabular website, chunked by XT

    In order for the XT chunking process to succeed, all necessary
    subdirectories must be created before you begin running XT.
